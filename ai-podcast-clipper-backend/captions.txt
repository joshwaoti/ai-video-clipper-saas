MI6 with the intelligence you've also a

43
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,680
book offer very outspoken about certain

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,720
things in the world that need speaking

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,400
about but yeah it's good to have you on

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,480
it gives people a different spin of it

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,440
and a different understanding of the

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,680
importance of what actually goes on kind

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,840
of underground in the world and you've

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,599
lived at firstand basically yeah no

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,200
thanks very much for having me James

52
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,680
yeah I was legal director for MI5 and

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,000
six that was a fascinating job yes sure

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,319
so just before we into everything I

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,879
always go back to the start of my guest

56
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,280
but I just want how can so did you get

57
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,720
clearance to speak about certain things

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,720
yes yeah yeah and because there's not

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,440
many who do get clearance not at all so

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
you must be trusted then with the

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,040
information that you have to then yeah

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,200
when I when I first joined uh the

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,319
agencies um it was a time when they were

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,640
going from the cold war and in into

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,280
terrorism Cold War hadn't ended

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,440
um but there was a different take on

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,879
things and uh there had been some

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,720
problems with the Peter Wright book that

69
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,239
had been written illegally and they

70
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,319
tried to stop it and couldn't and they

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,599
decided that perhaps they needed um a

72
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:22,319
proper legal department plus the ability

73
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,560
for the agencies to talk to the Press so

74
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,599
my first job there apart from being the

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,000
lawyer was to be the liazal with the

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,400
with the media so I was able to talk to

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,400
the media got into this sort of habit of

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,959
talking about the things I could talk

79
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,080
about and about not about the things I

80
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,120
couldn't and therefore I've been trusted

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,560
since then to talk on the basis that I

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,080
won't say things that I shouldn't you

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,599
must be very well trusted then cuz

84
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,120
normally people speak out of skill but

85
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,720
again in that sort of environment i'

86
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,879
imagine it to be cut thren I know it's a

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,079
bit bit cringe for a man who's lived at

88
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,280
but you see or James Bonds and stuff MI6

89
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,120
people fascinating for people that sort

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,280
of obviously that's fiction but you know

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,400
the MI5 MI6 it's always it's NE to

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,319
Really Ever knows what's going on but

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,519
again before we get into every for know

94
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,079
I always like to go back to the start of

95
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,160
my guest David get a bit understanding

96
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,320
about you where you grew up how it all

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,040
began yes right well I think it sort of

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,240
started exciting because I was born

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,919
between two Air Raids in the war my

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,600
mother said the first bought me on and

101
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,240
the second finished me

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,800
off uh

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,960
and my father was was abroad in in uh um

104
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,880
Salon during the war he he operated

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,320
against Japanese when he came back uh he

106
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,880
set up an airline to South America with

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:51,120
a friend of his um in the RAF and so my

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,440
first trip to Brazil was when I was aged

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
six I was put into boarding school

110
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,720
obviously the parents lived abroad that

111
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,639
was exciting converted bomber across the

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,960
South Atlantic which in those days is

113
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,240
quite a good trip uh and spent a lot of

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,280
time summer holidays going out to see my

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,520
parents there a boarding school in

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,600
England which was um absolute Bliss

117
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,680
because no parental Authority soone was

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,199
totally independent and wild sort of set

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,160
one up for MI5 and

120
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,400
MI6 yeah so you had a pretty good

121
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,000
upbringing then pretty adventurous yes

122
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:35,160
indeed yeah it it was um tremendous and

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,120
and also meeting um kids one own age out

124
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,160
in South America Brazil Chile uh

125
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,360
Argentina um it gave one a very early

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,080
good scope on on other people in the

127
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,360
world how they lived and it was an

128
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,240
exciting it was a very exciting

129
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,120
childhood I used to live with my

130
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,440
grandparents they were out in a lone

131
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,160
rectory out in the in in the countryside

132
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,000
in in Huntington and there was some

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,720
latan refugees there soone got to know

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,919
them they were great F we used to roam

135
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,599
the fields with a Afghan hand and a cat

136
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:14,160
MH so yes very free very free childhood

137
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,800
was Dad around a lot was he around a lot

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
obvious I saw I saw him during summer

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,199
holidays was that that he he's brilliant

140
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,400
I mean both my parents are absolutely

141
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,039
brilliant never never had any problems

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,479
they were they were wonderful and they

143
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,080
let me free which I think is very

144
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,919
important as a child because obviously

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,919
with not having the parents around there

146
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
people's life can go totally different

147
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,919
and I always speak about this but the

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,319
majority of people who get involved in

149
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,759
crime come from the broken home and it's

150
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,520
not as if your parents abandoned you but

151
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
they weren't there where you've got the

152
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,599
fun kind of discipline from your father

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,639
and the loving energy from your mother

154
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,919
did it affect you in any way growing up

155
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,879
or did you just feel free and Alive

156
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,759
because you traveled the world had good

157
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,520
grandparents yep we we a good kid then

158
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,000
no no

159
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,440
[Laughter]

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,199
I was usually in trouble at school but

161
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,120
we we had an interesting system um

162
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,800
boarding school um boarding school I I

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,520
was boarding school in in Huntington and

164
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,720
then downside boarding school in in

165
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,400
Somerset and uh the the heads of both

166
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,879
those schools believed in a lot of sport

167
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,599
and and right from the beginning at at

168
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,199
um boarding at my first boarding school

169
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,160
we were all put into boxing for the

170
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,960
first term and uh that was very

171
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,440
carefully managed because those kids who

172
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,400
didn't like it weren't pushed to it the

173
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,000
other kids who seem to get on with it

174
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,479
were taken on and taught boxing and I

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,039
think in a sense that teaches you two

176
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,479
things first of all how to look after

177
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,000
yourself and second if you've got an

178
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,680
opponent that um one might be being

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,840
beaten up oneself which happen quite

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,919
frequently but if you're you're in a

181
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,199
position where you're stronger than your

182
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,680
opponent you also have to start thinking

183
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,960
well do I really want to take this guy

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,919
out there's no no point to it so it also

185
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,479
teaches you a balance in life that I

186
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:16,039
think that has stayed with me uh ever

187
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:20,120
since yeah it's that's so important for

188
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:22,479
any sort of combat for any young man on

189
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,479
this planet whether it's boxing karate

190
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,800
myay Thai whatever it is any sort of

191
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,440
combat sport is so good for the mindset

192
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,760
also cams you an individual because

193
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,800
every mad man I know every guy who

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,080
shouts and screams are the ones who

195
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
can't fight I used to train in a place

196
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,599
called the grip house in glasgo and do

197
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,959
myay Tha all right and you would never

198
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,760
think of these people in there were

199
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,440
train Killers they're just so Placid

200
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,160
skateboarders just getting on with our

201
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,720
life not everybody but I'm just there

202
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,920
were just good people they never

203
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,200
screamed or shout but you go to the

204
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,880
local pub everybody's loud everybody's

205
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,000
daed it's just for me it shows a sense

206
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,440
of weakness never realized that for many

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,200
years later but we're living in a very

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,519
sof in generation it's the gayest

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,880
generation we've ever been in I think

210
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,640
one and every five is gay by trans and I

211
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,399
have no issues with any it but we

212
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,800
becoming very soft and weakened for men

213
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,160
and women's roles naturally on this

214
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,240
planet we're kind of lost in a system

215
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,000
where everybody's confused and it's a

216
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,240
soft very soft and weakened generation

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,839
that we're in yeah I I've got nine

218
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,040
grandchildren ranging from a doctor down

219
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:34,120
to a um a grandkid who want to go out

220
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,120
and help penguins in

221
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,519
Antarctica and I find in their own way

222
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,320
they're very strong

223
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,240
mentally

224
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,240
um I I I agree I mean certainly for my

225
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,680
generation the sort of wartime

226
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,920
Generation Um we were all bought up to

227
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,200
scrub a floor if things went wrong you

228
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,079
know you couldn't sit down and and think

229
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,519
about life too much you you were sent

230
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:58,800
out to do

231
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,200
things uh I think that has changed I'm

232
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,079
not sure that it's changed for the worse

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,240
I think we've got a certainly a

234
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:09,320
generation that I look at Generations

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,040
aging from 32 down to

236
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,079
10 that seem to me to have life pretty

237
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,079
well under control Maybe I'm

238
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:20,120
Wrong yeah I just feel as if it's

239
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,040
becoming a weaker Society I don't know

240
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,640
why um but more people more light T to

241
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,360
addiction crime um a lot of people

242
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
struggle mentally now suicide rates

243
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,079
through the roof as well

244
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,399
there's a lot

245
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,440
of external things out there that people

246
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,160
seem to be gravitating towards instead

247
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,839
of I don't listen to systems a system

248
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,600
but a lot of people are

249
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,320
struggling mentally financially and I

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,279
think some sort

251
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,000
of more discipline of the old school

252
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,160
mentality of toughen up a little bit

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,600
push on P the big boy pants up and kick

254
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,320
on but again everything's feelings and

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,320
emotions and I understand that as well

256
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,959
but I just feel for the men side of

257
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,920
things I don't know if it's as strong as

258
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,880
it was 50 years ago 70 years ago men

259
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,440
were more respected they looked after

260
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,880
themselves well but I just feel as

261
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,680
things are changing a little more maybe

262
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm wrong as well but that's just for

263
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,920
the people who are interviewing the

264
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,399
things that I see I just and

265
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,079
homelessness as well a lot of big

266
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,079
numbers are through the roof and a lot

267
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,800
of struggles yes that that that that's

268
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,959
the struggle I think is is is harder I I

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I think that's certainly right I think

270
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,959
in many ways I've been very lucky to

271
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,639
work with um people who are able to look

272
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:39,920
after themselves certainly in five and

273
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:43,800
six I mean the women and men there are

274
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,519
um incredible um and they they they look

275
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,839
after themselves but they also um

276
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,200
understand where the stresses and

277
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,920
strains come from uh and they're able to

278
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,560
handle them um and that Society is

279
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,040
completely across the board I mean from

280
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,600
University done people who who are not

281
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:07,680
done but across to to people who've

282
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:11,079
entered very young um and they all work

283
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,240
together whether that's the whether

284
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,360
that's partly because they've been

285
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,680
chosen to have that particular mentality

286
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,639
and ability I don't know I I don't

287
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,440
despair of the younger generation put it

288
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,279
that way yeah how long did you un

289
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,199
boarding school for um from six till I

290
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,079
left it when I was 17 so left at a very

291
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:34,480
young age to kind of find find it for

292
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,519
find out for yourself what life was

293
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,480
about that was really good because um I

294
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,120
came out at the time when national

295
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,720
service had finished I was too young to

296
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
do national service but a lot of people

297
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
went to University and my Headmaster

298
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,160
said David you're going to waste your

299
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,600
time at University go straight in and um

300
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,240
do an apprenticeship in the law which I

301
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,480
did uh so I had 4 and a half years

302
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,639
starting licking stamps on envelopes

303
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,240
being given all the worst

304
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,800
clients generally being kicked around

305
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,480
did me an enormous amount of good uh

306
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,440
again I think I was lucky because I was

307
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,519
able to be independent and free one

308
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,720
could sort of

309
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,079
handle uh that did everybody else had

310
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,360
that mindset though David at the

311
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,880
boarding school where it was kind of get

312
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,800
on with it and thing for yourself

313
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,320
basically yes did everybody have that

314
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,680
was it because it was more discipline or

315
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,199
like you say it was a bit more freedom

316
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,760
but it was a lot of discipline of this

317
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,360
is your structure this is your plan this

318
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,480
is your daily routine there was more

319
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,240
routine to your life would it gave you

320
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
more purpose yes do you think that's

321
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,760
important I think that's very important

322
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,279
what about national service do you think

323
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,399
that should be come back I think it was

324
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,720
very good when it was when it was there

325
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,440
I there's a big debate about that at the

326
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,480
moment

327
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,120
um whether or not we need it in terms of

328
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,440
setting up a a structure to protect

329
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,199
ourselves against possible

330
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,920
putinism um I don't know I leave that I

331
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:13,399
leave that to the military uh again I I

332
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,040
I I I get where you're coming from about

333
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,279
discipline and I think it is incredibly

334
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,560
important um

335
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,800
but I think also my generation were used

336
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,240
to a much sort of harder environment we

337
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,000
we didn't see chocolate until until he

338
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,759
was six you know as my grandkids keep

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,360
groaning you know he's going to tell us

340
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,160
all about the first banana he had you

341
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,040
yeah yeah every every generation's

342
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,440
different obviously my grandparents they

343
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,880
fought in the wars and I love them bits

344
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,720
and but when in Glasgow the bombing and

345
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,959
Clay bank and try to bomb the ships like

346
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,839
they were getting through it all the

347
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,079
lights were Switched Off there was no

348
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,440
electricity when you see people struggle

349
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,480
today you think what is it you're

350
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,560
actually struggling about like we've got

351
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,279
it so good but I don't know again if

352
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,920
technology plays a massive part of

353
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,759
people's mindset where it's slowing it

354
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,320
down and everything's reals and

355
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,680
different videos and constant of trying

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,040
to portray a fake life to try and fit in

357
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,959
with people who don't really care about

358
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,720
you anyway so even though it was more

359
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,440
difficult probably to survive back then

360
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,519
especially with food I just think now

361
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,079
technology can damage mindsets as well

362
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,920
where people can get stuck in a bubble

363
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,000
so everything changes through time and

364
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,639
obviously we guinea pigs for mobile

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,639
phones and technology and radio and all

366
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,560
the stuff that comes from it but it's

367
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,240
just this is why it's important these

368
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
podcasts is to get an understanding of

369
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,319
your life and what you've went through

370
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,319
and how you dealt with it and what you

371
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:44,880
overcome so was there much discipline in

372
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,519
the boarding school then for you to then

373
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,920
yes purpose one used to get beaten

374
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,440
frequently did you oh yes if what for

375
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,360
what reason um if you didn't if if you

376
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,959
failed to put in your homew work um that

377
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,600
that would certainly get you can

378
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,519
and uh I mean if if you were ever caught

379
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,399
going down to the pub you know that

380
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,680
would certainly be a very very good

381
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:14,279
caning I remember once I I um bought my

382
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,680
um I had a little 2 two air rifle that

383
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,800
my grandfather had given me and I bought

384
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,000
that to school to shoot the pigeons I

385
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,160
was found out that eared me a caning as

386
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,639
well so yeah uh it never did one any

387
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,600
harm I I'd much prefer to be can or then

388
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,519
than put in my room for the day it was

389
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,319
only a quickly and you get on with life

390
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,639
did anybody ever become more not

391
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,600
Authority but against the system because

392
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,839
they were getting Ked a lot people more

393
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,160
people fragile towards it sure yeah I

394
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,079
mean there were there were but then on

395
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,480
the whole they were sensible and kept

396
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,399
clear of of the problems that might earn

397
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,519
them that that difficult yeah you never

398
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,519
listened you were get back for more

399
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,680
punishment what did you do after boting

400
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:05,000
school David yes I I went in I I went

401
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,760
into um apprenticeship as a law yes

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,720
which I found really exciting my I I

403
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,679
went in with my uncle and he he was the

404
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,679
lawyer who defended Ruth Ellis who was

405
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,760
the last person last woman to be hanged

406
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,360
in England um that damaged him

407
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,000
enormously uh but he was a very very

408
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,120
good criminal lawyer he had no hope to

409
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,559
to save Ruth Elis of course because she

410
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,039
was caught pumping Six Bullets into

411
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,559
someone was quite difficult to

412
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:37,080
to

413
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:41,760
precisely uh so he he taught me um

414
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,919
criminal law and I was able after my my

415
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,840
apprenticeship um to go into the courts

416
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:51,720
which again was very exciting and uh

417
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:56,280
kept one on one's toes so yes then I

418
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,280
went into private practice um and uh

419
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,440
after about 3 years I I looked looked at

420
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,080
the partner the senior partner the

421
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,400
consultant and the guy who had just been

422
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,720
put in the ground I thought this isn't

423
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,240
for me I need something more exciting

424
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,679
and my wife Carrie uh bought me an

425
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,880
advertisement which said they were

426
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,720
looking for a legal advisor to the

427
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,679
government of the Turks and Kos islands

428
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,880
in the Caribbean and we looked at each

429
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,200
other and said well let's go which was

430
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,039
which was great so I wound up in the

431
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,159
Turks and Kos Islands um now that that

432
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,760
was was

433
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:36,880
fascinating the uh time was the

434
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,000
ministers there wanted to move away from

435
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,840
what was fishing uh in into a tourism

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,760
industry and also at that time they were

437
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,039
setting up Finance centers what we call

438
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,000
tax

439
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:53,280
Havens and uh my job there was to draft

440
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,840
the legislation to help that happen very

441
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,120
exciting time why did you never go down

442
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,360
the foot the kind of same footsteps as

443
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,840
your father King the

444
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,559
military uh I sight but also I was I

445
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,480
wasn't really um keen on that and he he

446
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,880
was he was in so he didn't force that

447
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,200
upon you then no not at all because I

448
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,760
know you said you were going to do the

449
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,000
but someone gave you the guidance to do

450
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,280
law instead you're going to go down that

451
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,360
route but yeah I I I wanted to do the

452
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,120
law I think largely because my uncle was

453
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,880
defending Ruth Ellis at the time and it

454
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,159
was very exciting and I thought that

455
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,799
that would be a great career to have

456
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,640
uh and that's what took me into the law

457
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:37,120
my my father said you do what you want

458
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,080
so supportive then yeah that's important

459
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,640
so see the women who got hanged the last

460
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,919
women to get hanged and the UK was what

461
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,080
did she do shoot someone six she shot

462
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,039
her lover yeah six

463
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,640
times he he was a he he was a a bastard

464
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:55,799
no doubt about that today of course she

465
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,400
would have got away with man slaughter

466
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,080
and been in for six months I mean he was

467
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,799
so bad but in those days you didn't have

468
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,360
a defense um of dominish responsibility

469
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:12,360
so she she was hanged which was a ping

470
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,360
I'm in a paing what year was this 40s

471
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,000
1957 it's mad that 53 yeah 53 only a few

472
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,120
years ago that people used to get was it

473
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,559
in the street or was it in court she got

474
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,360
hanged how did it work back then oh she

475
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,600
in in prison was it in prison to hang

476
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,280
them yes I know people used to hang hung

477
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,960
in the streets and yeah all that yes yes

478
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,960
I don't know if that was 1800s and [ __ ]

479
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,080
that was but it was pretty gruesome so

480
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,640
you ended up in the Cayman Islands ended

481
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,440
up in to Kos Islands which is near

482
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,400
nearby the Cayman Islands the bottom end

483
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,240
of the Bahamas chain and how was that

484
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,720
experience that that was extraordinary I

485
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,760
mean first of all the West Indians are

486
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,360
wonderful so one had a absolutely bissal

487
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,880
relationship with them which was which

488
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,679
was great

489
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:01,039
friendly um it was an open book to be

490
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,240
able to um help create the legislation

491
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,840
for a tourist industry and and and um a

492
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,840
finance Center which was really

493
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,200
interesting then of course there were

494
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,320
the Americans there were two bases there

495
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,880
um one base was for the Navy Seals the

496
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,279
other base was for the RAF satellite

497
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,400
station so we watched the moon landing

498
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,720
there which was pretty

499
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,240
amazing actually in their ciz

500
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,080
station

501
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:34,840
uh and um we had trouble with the

502
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:39,240
Cubans uh and we also had a very strong

503
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,080
uh chief of police there uh and um I

504
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,520
mean there sort of thing that would

505
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,000
happen in Turks was he came into my

506
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,000
office and he said David he said you

507
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,240
going to come with me so I went out with

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,200
him we went up to the airport and there

509
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:57,240
was the um guy who used to run the local

510
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Airline run Aztec to an engine Aztec he

511
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,360
was an ex um

512
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,880
bomber pilot low-level bomber pilot and

513
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,240
we climbed on board and um Andy said as

514
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
we were going out he said we're going

515
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,120
out because we've got a Cuban fishing

516
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,679
boat fishing in our Waters well at that

517
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,120
time we were having a r with Cuba about

518
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:22,360
who owned what as far as the the fishing

519
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,240
uh um the fishing area was concerned

520
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,799
anyway we went off and I said to to um

521
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,320
Andy well you know what are we going to

522
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,559
do because this guy won't have any

523
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,720
number plate as it were we won't be able

524
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,000
to land in the sea and do anything iing

525
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,760
said watch B took us in very very low

526
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,320
and Andy had two packets of yellow dye

527
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,240
that he lent out of the window and

528
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,039
dropped and he missed this boat there

529
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,600
was yellow dye everywhere the boat was

530
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,919
absolutely untouched anyway he told

531
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Barkley to go back and give a really low

532
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,840
pass just to scare this guy and all he

533
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
got was the finger as we went by from

534
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,279
the captain of this fishing Pap so that

535
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,120
was law enforcement in the turx and caos

536
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,679
Island how long were you there for two

537
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,320
years another another good experience

538
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,960
then yeah very very good uh huge

539
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,120
learning curve to learn well how to

540
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,679
draft legislation for a start how to uh

541
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:29,799
convert the um ministers wishes in in

542
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,279
into law so that they got what they want

543
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,400
um and also to try and write in

544
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:39,960
protections that uh meant the tax Haven

545
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,840
wasn't going to be used for criminal

546
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,919
purposes that has never really been

547
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,440
successful for any tax Haven because of

548
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,559
course they are used for criminal

549
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,480
purposes yeah it's still tax free isn't

550
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,600
it C is yeah they're all tax free so who

551
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,400
own who runs a c Islands Britain so

552
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,400
they' still run by British still to this

553
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,440
day so why is it allow

554
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,039
then cuz there's always loot Poes

555
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,480
everywhere and people find the loot Poes

556
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,600
but that's always been the place for

557
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:13,840
people to then take that money yes it it

558
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,159
it's a very good point um the islands

559
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,760
themselves aren't

560
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:22,480
self-sufficient so they need tourism and

561
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,039
they need to be a financial um offshore

562
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,320
there's nothing wrong with being a

563
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,799
financial offshore because that enables

564
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,880
um corporations to deal with their or

565
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:35,840
International corporations to deal with

566
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:40,320
their um economy uh sensibly and and an

567
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,960
uneven Keel um the problem is how do you

568
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:48,279
stop uh money launderers um criminals

569
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,080
organized criminals terrorists using

570
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:52,039
these

571
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,880
islands the um there are international

572
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,760
agreements of course which uh govern the

573
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,720
use o o of these islands but

574
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,600
nevertheless

575
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,480
it's almost impossible these days to

576
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,200
ensure that you know exactly who is

577
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,720
coming to deal in your Ireland or what

578
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,840
money they're putting through the

579
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:18,039
books there are various ideas that one

580
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,840
has put on the plate I I spent oh four

581
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:24,679
years after I left the agencies dealing

582
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:27,919
with um tax Havens on the basis of

583
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,760
creating legislation to avoid the

584
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,360
problem of money

585
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,320
laundering but uh I I can't see um any

586
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,320
particular way of stopping it all

587
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,600
together unless you just shut down tax

588
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,240
Havens but is that not a good way then

589
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,640
for like you say it's British it's

590
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,840
British rule so is it a good way also

591
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,520
for people who are putting big money in

592
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,039
these offshore accounts to then get an

593
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,919
understanding of who are they that's

594
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,880
doing it that may be the case I wouldn't

595
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,159
answer that question yeah because it's

596
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,120
pretty then for me looking at the

597
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
outside of having these offshore

598
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,159
accounts if it loads them because it's

599
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,840
the people who are C with the crop it's

600
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,120
not your average guy here just try to Lo

601
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,039
their money a few thousand you're

602
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,399
talking hundreds of millions possibly

603
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,640
billions um so it's like banking system

604
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,919
here there's red flags if somebody gets

605
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,399
more money than they should there's a

606
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,200
phone from the bank says look where's

607
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:23,080
that coming from or they'll froze your

608
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,360
accounts which is understandable but

609
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,600
there is it easy enough to set up or

610
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,120
there's a lot of regulations that you

611
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,559
have to go through rules and regulations

612
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,799
you have to go through to then set

613
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,360
things up yes yes you have to it's not

614
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,799
just a case of easy going on a phone or

615
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,919
an app going a bank no you can't do that

616
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,559
you have to show you know who who

617
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,960
exactly you are and where your money is

618
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,360
coming from the the difficulty is with

619
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,919
organized crime of course they they

620
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,840
employ lawyers accountants

621
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,840
Bankers uh anyone who's crooked in those

622
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,600
fields to advise them on how to do it

623
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,760
and how to get away with with uh

624
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,200
bypassing the regulations

625
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,760
and for for the organized criminals it

626
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,760
it is not that difficult obviously so

627
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,640
what what did you do when you come back

628
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,399
yeah I was asked to go into the foreign

629
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,640
office uh to be a lawyer there which um

630
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,880
again that that that's another

631
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,240
fascinating um life in the foreign

632
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,679
office you're traveling all over the

633
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,520
place you're meeting um people from all

634
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,520
nationalities dealing with with

635
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,039
different different aspects of

636
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,799
international relations I mean for

637
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:35,320
instance I was asked to um be the legal

638
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,960
advisor for um the British space program

639
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,799
that we were kicking off then that was

640
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,120
way back in the days where satellites

641
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,440
were just beginning and uh we had um I

642
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,640
remember two two International

643
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,720
agreements I was involved in one was the

644
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,320
International Space Station the

645
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,120
agreement that governs the running of

646
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,559
the International Space Station now who

647
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,000
would think there would be an agreement

648
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,919
to govern it but yes there is and it was

649
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,399
quite complex the other one was um uh

650
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,159
for in Marat when we were setting up the

651
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:08,840
first Earth stations governing how they

652
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,519
were to be used how Communications were

653
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,120
to come to the Earth station and how the

654
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:16,399
satellites were to be used very very

655
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,760
interesting stuff Cutting Edge then so

656
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,000
yeah who have you got to work with then

657
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,760
because obviously if they're putting sat

658
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,640
anyone can put satellites up they got to

659
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,480
be OB see you get China Russia UK

660
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,960
America has everybody got to be in

661
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,159
agreement to how many satellites they

662
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,559
can put up or is it a free-for all that

663
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,919
people can do what they want well no you

664
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,080
you it it is pretty much a free-for all

665
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,360
I mean you there thousands and thousands

666
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,679
as yeah and what's really interesting

667
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:45,760
about that is um one of my grandsons his

668
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,399
dissertation for his last year at uh

669
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,799
swans uni because he's studying

670
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:53,039
aerospace engineering his

671
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:56,720
dissertation is how do you capture space

672
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,840
junk and dispose of it safely so it's

673
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,279
sort of Full Circle we have a bit of a

674
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,039
laugh because he looks at me and he

675
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,159
thinks good grief he said you weren't

676
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,559
really talking about that back then

677
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,799
probably blame

678
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:13,480
you for creating for yes so how how

679
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,080
advanced was it back then though I

680
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,840
always believe but I don't know I'm not

681
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,320
in the know of being in that Society

682
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,679
where where you're in and you're working

683
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,399
with it but I believe the government

684
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,600
whoever it is are always 50 years 100

685
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:27,559
years possibly more ahead of the stuff

686
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,600
that we get now what was the advance

687
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,519
like with that technology then was it

688
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
because obviously you can get the

689
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,760
satellites now that can come down and

690
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,880
you can view people who've seen it now

691
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,880
the proof is there but was it advanced

692
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,840
in70s was it no not at all no I

693
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,440
mean this wasn't long after Yuri kakar

694
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,840
had made the first man space flight you

695
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,120
know so it it was very unsophisticated I

696
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,679
mean at the time of course it was the

697
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,320
most sophisticated thing you could

698
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:01,120
possibly think of watching the the moon

699
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,360
landing in in 69 I think it was um

700
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,760
Armstrong oh I mean that's just

701
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,080
remarkable I this was way out of sight

702
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,880
did you see this because there's a lot

703
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,200
of people are skeptical that the

704
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,320
moonlandings were fake oh I I was in the

705
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,440
the US um tracking station on Turks and

706
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,120
Kos which actually followed the

707
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,880
moonlanding I was there and watched it

708
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,559
so yes I can say it was real that's mad

709
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,200
David that you've witnessed that

710
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,240
people can make videos up now again I

711
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,559
I'll stay open-minded to everything

712
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,919
because I've never seen it with my own

713
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,960
eyes so I'll always be skeptical like I

714
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,200
say I can never discredit anybody or I

715
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,880
could never be

716
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,000
100% proof because I've never seen those

717
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,519
things but it's still intriguing I would

718
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,640
love to think the moonlandings were real

719
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,440
I'd love to think they were bouncing

720
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,679
about in space in the late 60s and

721
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,120
obviously with the technology now I

722
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,480
think our mobile phones have more

723
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,279
technology in it than the spacecrafts

724
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,200
actually went to them in yeah um what

725
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,440
were you thinking then when you seen

726
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,600
someone on the

727
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,440
moon I was thinking this is just unreal

728
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,200
I mean it was it was sheer excitement I

729
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,039
mean the excitement in that room you

730
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,679
know in in the tracking station was

731
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,240
immense I mean the Americans were just

732
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,000
kcko was a huge achievement for them was

733
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,519
very exciting yeah why have they never

734
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,639
sent anybody back I really don't know I

735
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,639
I

736
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,600
think I I I I think that they found that

737
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,519
very very difficult I mean it

738
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,480
the cost is just

739
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:37,559
immense uh and if one looks at the cost

740
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,399
of what what went into that then I mean

741
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,320
people would cill at that now because I

742
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,480
know musk is trying to get people to ma

743
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,880
do you think that's a possibility oh

744
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,840
I've Carrie and I have booked our place

745
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,880
to Mars because we re that if if Mars is

746
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,919
populated they're going to need built-in

747
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,200
grandparents you've got the technology

748
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,440
and they know any how to make it last

749
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,200
what about I know it's a bit of out

750
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,559
there question but what about UFOs

751
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,480
intelligence out there do you believe

752
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,679
there's other species out

753
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:15,240
there there may very well be I mean I I

754
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,880
don't believe in UFOs um I I I I've

755
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,679
never seen anything that's convinced me

756
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,039
a bit like you I'd need to actually see

757
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,639
it before I believed it whether or not

758
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,000
there's life there may very well be

759
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:28,440
there's no reason why there shouldn't be

760
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,799
life puzzles me if I'm honest David the

761
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,360
the anatomy the brain the central

762
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,760
nervous system the creator of how we're

763
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,399
sitting here and there's cameras and and

764
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,000
how it happens at this time it just if I

765
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,600
think about it too much my mind can go

766
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,760
then sometimes I think as humans we can

767
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,519
SE too much and forget to actually just

768
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,519
live because life has a beautiful

769
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,279
Journey it's also very destructive as

770
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,440
well obviously we'll touch on that in

771
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,880
interview but it puzzles me life it

772
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,679
puzzles me how it's why we're here how

773
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,600
we're here who created us yeah yes and I

774
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,799
think that's goes back to what you were

775
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,799
saying earlier that that the more you

776
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,799
meet people the more you

777
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:16,039
travel the more puzzled you get yeah

778
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,480
yeah uh I I I I I was almost about to

779
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,799
say it's easier but actually it isn't I

780
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,840
it's a joy to meet other people and and

781
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,840
travel and see how they live and how

782
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,039
they all

783
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,399
interact um but what what I think is the

784
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,279
is how we manag to do it and in fact if

785
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,200
you look at the way we live although

786
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,080
we've got major troubles at the moment

787
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,440
in fact on the whole we got on pretty

788
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,679
well humans are decent people we are

789
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,480
decent people like AB if it's a

790
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,440
catastrophe whatever whatever people

791
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,799
human beings first instinct is to go and

792
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,760
help like we are good people we can get

793
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,240
caught up in a society of listen you get

794
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,639
beat up at school by the the teachers

795
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,799
and stuff that could send you in a

796
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:05,360
students imagine it would like I've been

797
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,840
speaking about you had alcoholic father

798
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,720
you had twins one became an alcoholic

799
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,560
like his father another one couldn't

800
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,800
even look at a drink cuz he didn't want

801
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,639
to be like his father so it's

802
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,159
everybody's get choices of you never

803
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,240
know your circumstances of your

804
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,639
upbringing either can really make you as

805
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,079
a child and make break you but it just

806
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,800
puzzles me life it pu genuinely because

807
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,639
I speak to so many different people

808
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,119
people and it puzzles me because you

809
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,639
talk about meeting all these people you

810
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,520
go into all these Tri everything's

811
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,639
tribalism so you get into all these

812
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,639
different tribes and cultures it's

813
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,000
amazing how all these people people look

814
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,440
different they speak different they

815
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,119
dance different they're more welcoming

816
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,639
they other people it's just how

817
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,359
everybody's traits are different why do

818
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,040
you ever think everybody can never just

819
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,639
go on in

820
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:59,160
life because we are all the same when

821
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,440
you break it all down as humans yes I

822
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,119
I I

823
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,400
think genetics has obviously got a lot

824
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:11,160
to do with with with how you how you act

825
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,280
I'm I'm sure of that I mean I think I

826
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,200
mean if you look back at boarding

827
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,200
schools some people were able to to um

828
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,839
take the slings and arrows much easier

829
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,480
than others why it's got nothing to do

830
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,480
with their upbringing I mean their

831
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,520
upbringing was probably the same as

832
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,280
anybody else's you know they didn't go

833
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,640
through a hard time being brought up

834
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,119
so I think I think there are genes that

835
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,160
are in one um particularly things like

836
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,760
alcoholism and things like that I think

837
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,400
I think that is

838
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:47,560
genetic uh and I think that

839
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,640
um the idea that one can sort of train

840
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,440
um train oneself to be one way or

841
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,440
another yes of course you can but it's

842
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,760
quite difficult yeah do you believe in

843
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,160
genetics DNA things can get passed down

844
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,040
of yes I do the same as the grandparents

845
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,119
the uncles because you've got Instinct

846
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,480
you have got Warriors out here you have

847
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,319
got leaders you've got these guys and

848
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,000
big white horses and the sword and

849
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:12,640
they're leading people into battle you

850
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,960
have got these leaders now not so much

851
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,480
they're leading people into battle but

852
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,200
they're winners you've got they're just

853
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,599
ingrained they're born to win they're

854
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,920
born to lead do you did you see that as

855
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,359
well when you're upbringing the people

856
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,560
you were surrounded if you just knew

857
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:28,079
that someone had they were just born to

858
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,760
lead yes do you see that feel that sure

859
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,760
certainly you did and um I think that

860
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,560
that that's certainly true of the

861
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,880
agencies too uh I mean the the these

862
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,640
these people are

863
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:47,880
born to um go into dangerous situations

864
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,839
to handle those situations come out

865
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,200
even- minded balanced which is hugely

866
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,680
important in the

867
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,160
agencies keep their integrity which is

868
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,200
equally important and

869
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:06,359
yes and in a sense the agencies look out

870
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,319
for those qualities or or attributes um

871
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,520
specifically to make sure that when

872
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:14,480
people are put into the agencies that

873
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,800
those attributes come to the for see

874
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,599
when you're in the Cayman Islands and

875
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,200
you're working all this stuff and then

876
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,800
you're seeing the moonlandings did you

877
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,359
realize then okay this is what your life

878
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,599
is about and that's what you wanted to

879
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,440
do no I always wanted to be a lawyer um

880
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:33,800
so yes I I I I think it was the

881
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,720
excitement of it MH uh I I've I've been

882
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,400
lucky in the sense of the laws um given

883
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,960
me a a really really adventurous life

884
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,760
I've done all sorts of jobs that have

885
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,119
been

886
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,000
exciting um I think it's exciting being

887
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:50,040
a lawyer uh providing you keep a sense

888
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,040
of balance how do you do that though you

889
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,240
have to stand back and again I think if

890
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,920
you are and I go back to this if if if

891
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,680
you're lucky enough to sort of not be

892
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,800
under parental influence all the time

893
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,680
and to be slung into a boarding school

894
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,520
where you have to look after

895
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,079
yourself one of the things you

896
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,400
absolutely need is a sense of balance

897
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,400
because I know a lot I've had qc's on

898
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,680
and lawyers and they never really seem

899
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,359
to switch off the the one when they're

900
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,880
working to go home with their work it's

901
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:26,119
always nonstop and they just love the

902
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,800
craft and the job and that sense of

903
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,280
listen it's a sense of power as you've

904
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,280
got someone's life in your hands did you

905
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,280
feel that no no I never I never felt

906
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,760
that because I think if if if one allows

907
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,160
oneself to think that you become

908
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,480
unbalanced mhm you either become too

909
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,720
cautious because you're worried about

910
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,319
the fact that you have got someone's

911
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,000
life in your in in your hands or you

912
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:53,240
become overconfident you know power what

913
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,040
makes a good lawyer balance is that what

914
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,800
it all comes down to you've got to be

915
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,040
able to stand outside your client and

916
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,960
look at them um

917
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,040
coldly balance up the pros the cons and

918
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,359
that was really important in the in in

919
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,839
the agencies and and also in the foreign

920
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,960
office what you're dealing with Russians

921
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:19,280
and Americans I mean if if ever you go

922
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,079
into a a meeting with with Russians or

923
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,040
or Americans in terms of moving towards

924
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,720
an agreement make absolutely sure that

925
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,280
when everybody sits down and says oh

926
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,000
we've reached that agreement you still

927
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,560
have one more document in your briefcase

928
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,720
to be able to hand back because the

929
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,040
Americans and the Russians will always

930
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,599
have one more point after everybody

931
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,200
thinks the agreement's finished yeah

932
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,560
that's why we probably get so much

933
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,560
distruction now because nobody's coming

934
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,800
to an agreement do you think what is

935
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,560
that is that tactics or is it ego is it

936
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,920
pride what is that tactics is that what

937
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,040
it is yeah sure because OB I actually

938
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,040
watched the put an interview did you did

939
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,319
you watch it his interview you done last

940
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,800
week you done an interview with Tucker

941
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:07,079
and H he says he had an agreement in

942
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,920
place it was Americans that pulled out

943
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,920
last minute or something and says no

944
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,040
yeah is that correct that could I don't

945
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,800
know I mean I don't know that's what

946
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,280
Putin says from his own mouth yeah I I

947
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,119
um I don't know I don't trust a word of

948
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,599
what he says so what happens then when

949
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,720
you come back C in isand you wor for the

950
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,000
what was it like working in the foreign

951
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,560
office that that was very exciting as I

952
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,280
say meeting meeting with with people

953
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,160
dealing with issues that that were

954
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:41,280
absolutely fascinating defense issues um

955
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,280
at that time uh sort

956
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,800
of did a lot of work with the Americans

957
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,319
countering drugs which was where I first

958
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,400
met met up with the

959
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:55,640
FBI uh w w which was absolutely

960
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,520
fascinating a lot of Human Rights work

961
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,720
which is something that we talk about a

962
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,280
lot now but back then human rights

963
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,960
really wasn't um understood terribly

964
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,520
well we we talked about balance of

965
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,040
fairness but of course we it became far

966
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,440
more sophisticated now you have a right

967
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,800
to life um you have a right to freedom

968
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:22,200
of speech but that right can be

969
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:26,800
curtailed if it's leads to Crime um that

970
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:30,480
sort of thing I think that uh the

971
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:36,240
balance is now aren't aren't properly

972
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:39,839
understood um I think the balance the

973
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,480
rights also have equal

974
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,640
responsibilities and I'm not quite sure

975
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,040
that we have got the hang of the

976
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,480
responsibilities that we need to balance

977
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,800
up rights many cases how bad do a drug

978
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,079
trade because cocaine if you go back to

979
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,720
the the plant the cocaine the ca it was

980
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:01,720
it plant called coca koca plant so you

981
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,920
go back to the Koka plant it's been here

982
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,079
for I think 3,000 4,000 years ago they

983
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,920
used to use it in like ceremonies and

984
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,200
they've had it in Coca-Cola and

985
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,480
obviously now they've changed that I

986
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,560
think it became bad in the' 70s but how

987
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,000
big is the the drug trade obviously it's

988
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,319
we'll touch on human trafficking which

989
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,839
has probably overtook the drug trade but

990
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,559
how big and is the trade in drugs all

991
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,800
around the world how organized is it

992
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,760
obviously you had Pablo Escobar and

993
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,160
other guys from the South American side

994
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,760
of things but obviously you've worked on

995
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:38,760
it firsthand how big is this trade it is

996
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,640
the interesting thing recently is uh

997
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,480
because the the the program of

998
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,800
eradication of drugs in Columbia and

999
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,280
places like that the cocoa Leaf has was

1000
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,839
stopped there's now a sort of glass of

1001
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,079
cocaine on the market and and therefore

1002
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,800
more cocaine is is coming

1003
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,079
through the interesting thing I heard is

1004
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,240
that that certainly the younger

1005
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,359
generation aren't particularly keen on

1006
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,760
on drugs the the younger

1007
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:13,200
generation um the I I think the biggest

1008
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:15,960
uses are sort of um 20s to 30s you know

1009
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:21,280
for for social Recreation for for

1010
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:24,440
cocaine yeah um the price of uh cocaine

1011
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,240
has gone right down recently because of

1012
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,119
the

1013
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,119
Glad um

1014
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,160
interdictions of of of drugs have gone

1015
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,680
up because there's more more flying

1016
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,599
around the place I think

1017
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,920
again when one talks about the social

1018
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,800
use of

1019
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:51,839
cocaine uh I'm not really sure that the

1020
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,960
users quite understand what they're

1021
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,640
getting into apart from the fact that

1022
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,480
medically of course it doesn't do you

1023
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,599
much good but what they don't understand

1024
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,559
is when they hand over I don't know 50

1025
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:10,839
60 quid um for

1026
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:14,400
cocaine uh that that 50 or 60 quid is

1027
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:16,440
going straight into the pockets of an

1028
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,520
organized crime

1029
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,440
organization and that money will help

1030
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:28,040
that organization continue to produce

1031
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,079
drugs at the same time as keeping people

1032
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,240
in order so what you're looking at is

1033
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,760
there is

1034
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:40,599
a almost direct correlation between the

1035
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,160
cash that goes into an organized crime

1036
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,599
organization via your street

1037
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,760
dealer goes to that

1038
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,880
organization goes to people who are

1039
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,480
being

1040
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,160
murdered

1041
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,839
killed

1042
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,319
tortured

1043
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,559
so when people take their line then not

1044
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,520
thinking about that they're not thinking

1045
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,880
oh my God actually this money is going

1046
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,720
into something that's absolutely

1047
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,319
appalling and keeping it going why not

1048
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,839
legalize it

1049
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,960
then you could Legalize

1050
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:17,000
It they've tried legalizing marijuana

1051
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,599
haven't they in the states W with pretty

1052
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,160
disastrous results they tried in

1053
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,119
Amsterdam

1054
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:29,960
uh I don't I don't see that legalizing

1055
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:32,400
it does much good I think that the the

1056
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,400
future will probably lie with with this

1057
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,040
new generation that's coming through the

1058
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,520
younger generation that are actually

1059
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,160
thinking it's just not cool yeah they

1060
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,640
want to keep their mind active and free

1061
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,920
I think that's what we need it needs to

1062
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,480
be taught is it's not cool it's damaging

1063
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,599
towards the brain it's damaging to the

1064
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,160
people around you you become a [ __ ] your

1065
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,440
person you become a [ __ ] your husband

1066
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,200
shut your father shut your brother shut

1067
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,440
your son like anything because I think

1068
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,839
was it Sigman Freud Freud which his a

1069
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,280
guy in the 1800s because the Coco plant

1070
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,319
he was getting benefits from it mentally

1071
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,319
but I think then people were taking

1072
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:09,319
mental breakdowns as well so everything

1073
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:11,359
grow from there you get the the heroin

1074
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:13,880
plant you've got heroin cocaine the

1075
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:17,440
poppy fields but it's how you manipulate

1076
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,960
it into what it does to the because I've

1077
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,680
spoke to drug lords I've been on the

1078
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,280
podcast they says we're putting tires on

1079
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,160
it um which causes cancer to the brain

1080
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,359
um cement rat poison cut yeah it's all

1081
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,240
cut so you're not even getting proper

1082
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:34,920
Cocaine by time it comes to the streets

1083
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,880
it's only like 10 20% of the [ __ ] that

1084
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,240
people are snotting but again it's a big

1085
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,640
business did what was it like then what

1086
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,040
with the FBI did you know what you were

1087
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,640
getting yourself involved with yes I was

1088
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,880
interest I mean the first the first case

1089
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,280
funnny enough I had was in Turks and Kos

1090
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,680
islands and and there was um a

1091
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,119
businessman there who who had built a

1092
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,800
huge house on the edge of the Sea gold

1093
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:01,240
plates in on the T apps and things like

1094
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:04,280
that you know we got interested in him

1095
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,440
uh we knew that if we tried to prosecute

1096
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,000
this particular person in the T and Kos

1097
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,520
silence he was so powerful there that

1098
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,240
probably wouldn't get a jury conviction

1099
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:19,440
so we asked the FBI to come in they sent

1100
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:23,000
in an agent that they used um countering

1101
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,520
narcotics in in Ecuador I think it was

1102
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,359
and that was the first time I saw an

1103
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,000
operation

1104
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,640
go radically wrong we sent him in with a

1105
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,960
war to meet up with this uh uh

1106
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,319
businessman on the pretext of

1107
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,240
introducing a new line of um Coca to

1108
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,960
come through the isands by air and uh he

1109
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,200
he was met on the doorstep of This

1110
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,200
Magnificent house and the businessman

1111
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,960
said well come on outside and we'll have

1112
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,480
a rum punch goes outside there is is on

1113
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,760
the Terrace overlooking the sea the wind

1114
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,800
had turned Northwest we couldn't hear a

1115
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,400
thing on couldn't hear a thing on the

1116
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:06,440
wire just of the sea coming in what you

1117
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,960
thinking then was this was this a drug

1118
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,200
lord this was a drug lord that we sent

1119
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,520
our or the FBI had sent their um

1120
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,680
informant into yeah yeah why did he not

1121
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,319
parties down for a wire why was he so

1122
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:23,040
confident that he weren't wired it it's

1123
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:28,960
extraordinary yeah and and that goes

1124
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:32,160
down to the um success of the

1125
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,520
Informer lulling the businessman into

1126
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:39,200
thinking that he really was a guy who

1127
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,720
wants to come in and sell a line to um

1128
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,800
to this guy to bring through the island

1129
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,960
is that what makes a good AG build in

1130
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,240
trust yes where you can walk in with a

1131
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,160
wire without any paranoia

1132
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,000
absolutely M it's mad how people can

1133
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,119
like because I've had so many undercover

1134
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
police officers on it blows my mind how

1135
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,079
cold he can be because the guy I had on

1136
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,200
his his podcast actually first he was an

1137
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,760
undercover gangster listen if I'm honest

1138
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,079
and I say to him I was always raised to

1139
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,000
hate the police because all my uncles

1140
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,799
they were all dodgy bastards you know

1141
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,880
what I mean so they're always we hate

1142
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:13,280
them because they were out to get them

1143
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,599
but you get grew up to hate them but

1144
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,359
then obviously you realize the job that

1145
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,440
they do is unbelievable the stuff that

1146
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,160
they see every day from the deaths and

1147
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,640
it's a negative job and they seen a lot

1148
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,000
of pain and I've nothing but respect for

1149
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,079
them for what they do now it took me

1150
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,160
many years to actually realize what

1151
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,920
these people do in their life and the

1152
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,240
sacrifices that they have to do to try

1153
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,000
and keep the the world in running order

1154
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,520
of course we need laws or else it be

1155
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,640
free-for-all out there cuz people are

1156
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,440
scatty but he went undercover as a

1157
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,960
gangster befriended this guy for two

1158
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,920
years and it was just about to pull the

1159
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,280
pull the plug on the guy and the guy

1160
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,799
asked him to be the Godfather his son

1161
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:56,160
yeah that's some dark [ __ ] to to pretend

1162
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:58,040
to it's like getting a bad wife who just

1163
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,480
[ __ ] you your money and it just pulled

1164
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,720
a wheel over your eyes for years and you

1165
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,760
believed all the [ __ ] but I feel as if

1166
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,760
for a man it would be harder to feel

1167
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,440
that you had a brother and then to find

1168
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,079
out it was all an act it must be

1169
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,040
difficult um because I remember watching

1170
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:16,040
the movie Don Brasco I don't know how

1171
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,200
how real it was but you've got to be

1172
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:21,760
some cold bastard as well to then do

1173
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,839
that life that's just because any sort

1174
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,480
of blown your cover you're dead you're

1175
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,240
not working with some two Bob [ __ ]

1176
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,480
who on the streets are working with the

1177
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,760
top the cream of the crop who kill for

1178
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,319
fun like were you were you nervous going

1179
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,480
into that

1180
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:40,359
job well I I was because being a lawyer

1181
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,520
yeah I wasn't actually I mean I went

1182
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:44,280
onto an operation in order to find out

1183
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,680
how are they operated in Northern

1184
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,520
Ireland once but it wasn't my job to go

1185
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,880
out on operations because there again

1186
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:56,880
you can get skewed you've got to stand

1187
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:59,400
back uh but obviously one as a lawyer in

1188
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,640
five and six one one one was involved in

1189
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,640
operations in order to um AE keep them

1190
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,760
legal which is Curious Thing to have to

1191
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:11,400
say but yes because the if if you

1192
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,839
operating against people it had to be

1193
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,079
necessary to do it and proportionate you

1194
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:19,440
know what you were doing was

1195
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,400
proportionate never ceased to impress me

1196
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,280
and one felt incredibly privileged

1197
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:30,319
working with these um agents men and

1198
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:34,160
women offic who who went up meeting um

1199
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,280
these um incredibly bad people winning

1200
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,880
them over winning their confidence

1201
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,000
getting the information that was

1202
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,000
necessary yeah yeah very impressive

1203
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,799
people indeed so see when you're the

1204
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,760
lawyer behind the

1205
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:48,960
scenes do have you got to brief them for

1206
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,400
what to say and where they've got to be

1207
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,880
because obviously there's a lot of red

1208
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,000
tape and certain areas they can be in

1209
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,599
certain areas they can gather

1210
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,640
information and evidence that you have

1211
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,400
to go through everything and where where

1212
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,799
they could travel where they could be

1213
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,119
like obviously if you're British you

1214
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:05,559
can't really go to America unless you've

1215
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,839
got clearance to then of stuff if you

1216
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,880
got to go through everything because if

1217
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,079
they go to court and there's one thing I

1218
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,160
miss they could get the court case

1219
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,799
throughout so if you got to be specific

1220
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,000
on certain things that they can do and

1221
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:20,599
be when they're on a job incredibly

1222
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,240
difficult too that there again one one

1223
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,040
was always impressed about how they

1224
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:29,520
worked under those conditions because

1225
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:33,160
one of the the problems um in in

1226
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:36,280
bringing um a case to court and that if

1227
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,880
if if one really wants to to get to the

1228
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,480
end game that's what it's all about

1229
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,599
trying to bring people to court I mean

1230
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,640
okay fine there are different different

1231
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,280
aspects these days in terms of trains

1232
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,880
and all the rest of it but the objective

1233
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,920
would be to get the the um criminals

1234
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,000
into court and prosecute

1235
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,839
them you're now dealing with

1236
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,200
intelligence which is secret and you're

1237
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:01,160
then having to

1238
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,200
translate that secret intelligence into

1239
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,480
open evidence in open

1240
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,240
court now that's quite a tricky business

1241
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,880
because uh what you have to do is to

1242
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,119
anticipate what evidence you can get

1243
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,040
into

1244
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,920
court that the

1245
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,280
defense a isn't going to challenge so

1246
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,160
it's got to be good evidence leading to

1247
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:27,520
a prosecution leading to a successful

1248
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,079
result second you have have to make sure

1249
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,920
that there's nothing that you're hiding

1250
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,440
that might help the

1251
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,240
defense so when you're planning an

1252
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,000
operation you have to plan it so not

1253
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:43,880
only do you get the information to

1254
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,040
convict but also you're not getting

1255
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,960
information that would be useful to the

1256
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,040
defense that could open up a whole line

1257
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:53,280
of inquiry to them that would help them

1258
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:56,799
in into another operation MH very very

1259
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,920
difficult very tricky and the um

1260
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:00,280
officers themselves who who who went

1261
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,680
into these

1262
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:05,240
operations were so good because they had

1263
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,599
to hold all that in their minds apart

1264
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:10,040
from the fact you're meeting with an

1265
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,760
agent in a dangerous situation or

1266
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,319
alternatively you're entering into a

1267
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,359
property planting a bug in an equally

1268
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,040
dangerous situation they had to come out

1269
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:22,160
write up reports not only about the

1270
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,119
intelligence aspect but also about the

1271
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,040
evidential aspect so that when you went

1272
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,240
into court you could show exactly what

1273
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,240
they'd been

1274
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:34,040
doing but hiding the secret stuff that

1275
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,400
didn't help the defense mhm so you're

1276
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,200
not just yeah but you're not just an

1277
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,319
average lawyer you're not someone who's

1278
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,960
going to the courts you're working all

1279
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,079
around the world it must have been some

1280
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,160
Buzz for you did you realize what you

1281
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,520

taking it like any other job no you have

1286
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,359
take it

1287
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:04,400
cies yeah absolutely

1288
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,240
um it was fascinating I mean one felt

1289
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,640
privileged you know every day you went

1290
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,400
into the office you were privileged

1291
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,880
because you were working with people who

1292
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,799
were so incredibly good so that was a

1293
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,559
huge privilege you were privileged

1294
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:22,839
because you were working with the

1295
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:25,480
law in a way where you were creating

1296
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:27,559
situations um sting operations that sort

1297
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,319
of thing is that that's the elite the

1298
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:31,280
best of the best working kind in these

1299
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:33,680
environment see yeah if you're looking

1300
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,200
at people like MI5 MI6 I mean you you've

1301
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,480
met the SAS and they are the Elite C

1302
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,760
absolutely CIA because the guy from a

1303
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,880
CIA he was just a university guy well so

1304
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,119
he says list you've got to take

1305
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,640
everything with a pinch OFA same as cuz

1306
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:50,160
you are so in that life you can feed me

1307
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,400
whatever information you want you're

1308
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,200
obviously very good at it but I

1309
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,039
understand it as well how it works when

1310
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,440
you can feed people what they want but

1311
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:00,400
he was CIA I can only go what he was

1312
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,559
saying he was top his class in

1313
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,039
University he got pinched from his

1314
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,160
university because they were looking at

1315
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,559
everybody's School sheets and they were

1316
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,240
recruiting they weren't just some

1317
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:15,039
special forces guy some match man this

1318
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:17,039
was a ner from University Top's class he

1319
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,720
recruited he thought it was a joke he

1320
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,240
thought it was some sort of joke that's

1321
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,000
what he says but I'd imagine that works

1322
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,400
they're just getting the best of the

1323
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,119
best and seeing what they can get from

1324
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,240
them is that how it works with sort of

1325
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,079
intelligence here as well yeah I mean

1326
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,039
funnily enough one one of the reasons

1327
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,039
I've written about a female um agent in

1328
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:40,400
in in the books is what is this new book

1329
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,440
will plug it as well yeah no but I I I

1330
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,839
was actually going to say that that if

1331
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:48,280
if if if you if you look at it I know my

1332
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,440
my youngest granddaughter who who

1333
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,880
actually got me into writing these books

1334
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,640
because she asked me down to her school

1335
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,119
to talk about

1336
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:01,079
spies but she reminded me so much much o

1337
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:04,160
of um the officers in the

1338
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:05,319
agencies very very talented very bright

1339
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,880
but you wouldn't want to meet them on a

1340
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:12,720
hockey field you know it's that sort of

1341
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,880
dual dual Edge yeah what is your book

1342
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,520
David the Russian spy one know what is

1343
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,559
the where people can buy it oh yeah

1344
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,079
that's ca ca uh is the first book and

1345
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,000
that deals with a Russian um

1346
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:28,039
intelligence agent in in the first book

1347
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,400
she's the chief operations officer of

1348
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:33,680
organization called the G8 intelligence

1349
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,119
agency a guy called cartright who was um

1350
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,960
president Gaddafi's money launderer

1351
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,640
president Gaddafi was the Libyan

1352
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:44,240
president who was killed he was not a

1353
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,480
very nice guy and cartrite goes off with

1354
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,720
half a billion of Gaddafi's private

1355
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,599
personal

1356
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,760
Fortune uh catcher is her father was a

1357
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,760
KGB officer he was a real real swine he

1358
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,720
he forced her into the

1359
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,760
into the um intelligence World on the

1360
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,799
other hand her mother was a a ballet

1361
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,240
dancer who had a very glamorous life and

1362
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,000
catches completely conflicted on the one

1363
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,839
hand she's forced into the intelligence

1364
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,359
World which she rather enjoys but on the

1365
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:17,480
other she'd love the glamour of her her

1366
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:19,559
mother's life so she is then asked to go

1367
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,799
and find this half billion

1368
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:26,200
dollars G cartri is protected by Ahmed

1369
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:28,280
and a group of very very senior internet

1370
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,119
ational terrorists so she's got to go

1371
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,079
through them which is totally terrifying

1372
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,839
of course then she enters the world of

1373
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:37,480
moneya laundering which is wholly

1374
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:39,839
corrupt and depraved I mean really nasty

1375
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:43,400
people operate in that world they really

1376
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:45,720
do uh so she goes out to Panama to find

1377
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,720
to find out where the money's gone and

1378
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:51,200
then winds up in ambergris which is a

1379
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:53,839
tax Haven run by a series of corrupt

1380
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,640
ministers uh and of course she has a

1381
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:00,440
love affair there the question of course

1382
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:03,200
is you know does she go off with him or

1383
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,359
does she go off with the money like a

1384
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,200
treasure hunt like a treasure hunt where

1385
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,119
can people buy your book David they can

1386
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,079
buy it on Amazon water stones and uh

1387
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:16,640
hatchards I think bookstores we'll leave

1388
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:18,799
a link in the description so MI5 MI6

1389
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,720
intelligence how does one get involved

1390
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:26,559
with MI5 and MI6 how does it come about

1391
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:28,760
David yeah I nowadays it's um you you

1392
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,000
can apply it's all on the website if

1393
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,680
you're interested in the agencies you

1394
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,039
you apply they advertise for for for

1395
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:40,240
officers um I I I was very lucky because

1396
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,160
I'd been involved in defense work in the

1397
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,559
foreign office and also I'd been

1398
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:48,880
involved in dealing with um The

1399
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:52,640
Americans on on counter you know Counter

1400
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,559
Narcotics and as I said earlier the

1401
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,799
there was a sea change in moving from

1402
00:59:54,559 --> 01:00:00,039
the Cold War I um

1403
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:02,720
counterterrorism and they needed a a

1404
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:04,640
sort of different view from from the

1405
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:08,079
legal point of view it needed to be more

1406
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,720
legal rather than um illegal if you see

1407
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,119
what I mean uh because you cannot

1408
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,160
prosecute terrorists unless everything's

1409
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,480
as I said earlier everything is straight

1410
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,720
up and down you've got to be able to go

1411
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,079
to court and show that they are truly

1412
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,760
guilty and you're not hiding anything so

1413
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,799
uh I was asked to go in and help with

1414
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,160
the change which was very lucky it was a

1415
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:32,160
perfect time to go in another blank

1416
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,839
sheet of paper if you like what's the

1417
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,359
difference between MI5 and MI6 MI5

1418
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:40,240
operates in within the jurisdiction MI6

1419
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:42,960
operates outside the

1420
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,240
jurisdiction or outside the country but

1421
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,760
of course These Days International

1422
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,720
terrorism International organized crime

1423
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,240
it's all International so in a sense

1424
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:58,000
there's a a a cover over both and of

1425
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:01,319
course they have joint um organizations

1426
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,599
that that operate to to um bring

1427
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:06,880
together both agencies doing their work

1428
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,240
hopeful are they MI5 because obviously

1429
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,599
you've got your Russians you've got your

1430
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,400
Americans you've got your Chinese how

1431
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:15,400
are we up there with intellingence or is

1432
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,440
everybody kind of under the same

1433
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,520
umbrellas or one better than

1434
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,720
another no I think they're all under the

1435
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,880
same umbrella thanks well yeah I do

1436
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:27,559
think so yes so the the standard is is

1437
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,880
is as I said earlier is incredibly high

1438
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:32,640
so yes they they all operate together

1439
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,720
and that that doesn't exclude gchq

1440
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,640
either so what's it like them being in

1441
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,520
that environment what can you talk about

1442
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,000
like how does it operate your daily

1443
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,119
routine is it do you get a different job

1444
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,960
every day or you on one for months how

1445
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,760
does it work well it can be I mean some

1446
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,640
people are on them for months because

1447
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,880
you the these are long-term

1448
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:57,359
investigations so uh you have teams

1449
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:59,799
operating obviously and um

1450
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,799
from my perspective no day was the same

1451
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:04,839
because one was doing all sorts of

1452
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,720
different operations one was dealing

1453
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:08,480
with

1454
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:11,599
legislation uh one was dealing with with

1455
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,520
the human rights aspects so that was a

1456
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,079
very exciting life as a lawyer very

1457
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,480
interesting life because I've

1458
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,480
interviewed enough police officers now

1459
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,279
to understand the police know everything

1460
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,760
especially with informers especially

1461
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,960
with all the intelligence that they've

1462
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:29,160
got now MI5 is a whole different level

1463
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,880
like is the whole world kind of looked

1464
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,920
upon is everything kind of understood

1465
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,400
because obviously if you've got these

1466
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,799
criminal activities and terrorism as a

1467
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,799
lot of intelligence know what's really

1468
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:39,720
going on everywhere or can still people

1469
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,319
still fly under the radar because even

1470
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,440
though there's Terror terrorism

1471
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:45,200
everywhere there's not been many attacks

1472
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,359
and the UK is that because of how good

1473
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:51,079
the intelligence is or is it just

1474
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,599
because there's only been a few T

1475
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:56,359
attacks in the UK and there shouldn't be

1476
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,640
any of course but we lost lives

1477
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:00,200
is that because there's not happening

1478
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,960
all the time because of how good the

1479
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,440
intelligence is here it is that that

1480
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,480
that is quite simply the answer is that

1481
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,319
that yeah and if if there if there

1482
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,440
wasn't here sorry to interrupt but if

1483
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,799
there was no MI5 MI6 do you think there

1484
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,119
would be te attacks every day well I

1485
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:19,400
wouldn't say that but there would be a

1486
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:23,839
lot more yes of course without a doubt

1487
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:26,319
uh they are their tentacles stretch wide

1488
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,720
um and and they are very very good at

1489
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:32,119
job there's nothing worse there's no

1490
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:35,559
worse feeling in the office if a

1491
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:39,319
terrorist attack gets through I it it is

1492
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:42,920
you know that that really is a Downing

1493
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:44,920
time um people feel Dreadful that

1494
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,319
something's got through that perhaps

1495
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:50,520
they should have seen or could have

1496
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:53,119
seen um but if you look at it there's a

1497
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:59,079
finite amount of

1498
01:03:53,119 --> 01:04:01,799
money to support MI5 and MI6 there's a

1499
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:05,000
budget and unlike James Bond there

1500
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:05,000
doesn't seem to be a budget at

1501
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:11,319
all uh you have to work within the

1502
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:16,160
budget and that literally means that you

1503
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:19,000
may be um studying a particular Target

1504
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:21,760
and uh it's been going on for a long

1505
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,279
time might be something out there might

1506
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,039
not be along comes another Target that

1507
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:28,240
might be more important you may have to

1508
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:31,680
give up the first Target and that's the

1509
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,680
Target that might come back and bite you

1510
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,559
CU you just don't have the money to do

1511
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,920
everything see I thought it there been a

1512
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:40,839
free-for-all as well where there was no

1513
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,400
money wouldn't be an issue course it is

1514
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:44,720
yeah that's mad it because especially

1515
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,559
with the intelligence that you could get

1516
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,720
to save potentially thousands of lives

1517
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,640
where there's not enough funding I know

1518
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,680
the funding police and stuff is terrible

1519
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:57,599
now they're dropping down numbers could

1520
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:00,559
that be could that have effect on crime

1521
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,160
in the future with not enough funding

1522
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:06,000
for people to protect and serve yeah I

1523
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:10,079
think I think what will happen is there

1524
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:14,319
will be I mean for instance we don't use

1525
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:16,039
um Telephone intercept as evidence every

1526
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,760
other jurisdiction in the world uses

1527
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:19,319
telephone intercept as evidence as

1528
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,559
listening inter phones well you can say

1529
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:22,920
well of course nobody talks on the phone

1530
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:24,680
these days because they all know they

1531
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,359
might be listened into but nevertheless

1532
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:29,839
they do it's just one of those Facts of

1533
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:32,240
Life the reason we can't use or we don't

1534
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:35,839
use intelligence

1535
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:39,039
um Telephone interceptors as evidence is

1536
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:41,960
or has been the cost because you have to

1537
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:44,119
bring together everything that is listen

1538
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,599
to and if you go to court that all has

1539
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:48,960
to go to court and be sifted through

1540
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,480
cost a load of

1541
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:55,240
cash I think what we may see in the

1542
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,599
future is AI will solve that problem

1543
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:01,720
because it will be able to deal with the

1544
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:03,520
huge amounts of of um of intelligence

1545
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,559
that that's secured by telephone

1546
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:08,359
intercept and translate in a way in

1547
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,599
which it can go to court in Far More

1548
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:12,119
cheaply than it can at the moment so I

1549
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,960
think AI is going

1550
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:17,039
to be incredibly useful in the future

1551
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,960
for intelligence work yes and and

1552
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:22,319
hopefully that that will solve part of

1553
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,680
the financial problem when did you find

1554
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:26,279
out about

1555
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:29,079
AI I have a friend who's working in the

1556
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:34,039
states very closely with um the hill on

1557
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:37,200
AI he's in uh Hopkins uh University uh

1558
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:40,359
so we've been talking about it for year

1559
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,680
or so yeah because I had a man called Mo

1560
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:44,200
on he worked for Google he created the

1561
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,039
ey he was one of the ones who created

1562
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,720
that really over 10 years ago

1563
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:49,880
fascinating and he said within the next

1564
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:52,960
5 to 10 years AI is going to be 1

1565
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,039
billion times smarter than any human

1566
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,279
yeah that's [ __ ] scary does that not

1567
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,279
scary David or no I think it's wonderful

1568
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:01,119
you think that's a good thing for like

1569
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:03,279
you say not cutting corners but getting

1570
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:06,000
to the the results and the answers

1571
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:07,480
faster than anyone could potenti because

1572
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,079
I said to him could they potentially

1573
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,599
then Rule the World um he says no he say

1574
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,599
it's not going to be like a Terminator

1575
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,839
where they're going to be in the streets

1576
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:19,839
and robots but he says it's so powerful

1577
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:22,319
that it's going to have a big S how the

1578
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:25,640
world is operated because it it doesn't

1579
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:27,799
want to it's just it's a machine I think

1580
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,640
we could be machines also we could be

1581
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:30,680
avatars or aliens like like I say I

1582
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,880
still don't know I don't have the

1583
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:35,640
answers maybe you do but I feel as if

1584
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,720
we're machines anyway well I think

1585
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:41,319
hasn't Elon Musk just planted implanted

1586
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,680
the chip brain mhm yeah and now you see

1587
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:46,200
people walking about with goggles

1588
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,039
different other metaverses and that

1589
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,079
there must be a true source to what

1590
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:52,119
we've come from maybe again this is

1591
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,400
another sort of metaverse maybe we we

1592
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:57,039
pass here we go back to the true source

1593
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,839
of what creat does genuinely again I

1594
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,640
don't know just from the people who I

1595
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:02,640
interview and try and get an

1596
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,960
understanding of life if I'm honest

1597
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,240
nobody really knows what the [ __ ] is

1598
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:09,119
going on no nobody's ever gave me a

1599
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,760
concrete answer no matter if it's CIA SC

1600
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,279
a school teacher a homeless man the

1601
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,279
billionaire nobody there's nobody really

1602
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:17,199
we're just kind of going through life

1603
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:19,920
trying to go through on a journey

1604
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:22,600
unscaved yes I think that's right I mean

1605
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,120
I I don't don't look at me for an

1606
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:28,440
answer I'm you have some secret ball

1607
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,239
the answers and some Einstein Bits of

1608
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,520
Paper down there that who create does

1609
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:34,719
I've got the answer

1610
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,359
absolutely someone must have the answers

1611
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,359
there must be in the archive somewhere

1612
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:41,199
where it's all started it's got to be

1613
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,040
you must have something Davey Boy tell

1614
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:47,000
the people what they want to know who's

1615
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,480
created us who is the UFOs is a it's

1616
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,319
just fascinating like even having you on

1617
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,000
it's just fascinating because you're

1618
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:54,759
very well spoken but it's clear you're a

1619
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,319
very well respected man to get to the

1620
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:59,120
level you've got if if you're building a

1621
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:01,279
team you want you in the team because

1622
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,120
you're very loyal to the cause and

1623
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,759
that's very rare to find these days well

1624
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,799
it's kind of you to say that I don't say

1625
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,600
it that way at all I just look at

1626
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:12,359
my life and think how incredibly lucky

1627
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,520
I've been you know I've been married for

1628
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,239
60 years you know that is lucky isn't

1629
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,239
that amazing I think a lot people might

1630
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:21,880
think different DAV I can't even keep a

1631
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:26,040
get for 60 minutes I need to take a leaf

1632
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:28,759
out your book is a yeah but are you

1633
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:31,719
British R and through David yeah yes I

1634
01:09:28,759 --> 01:09:34,319
am actually yes I mean not not that that

1635
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:38,799
matters I don't care you know what what

1636
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:41,679
I'd be actually I I don't see race at

1637
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:44,080
all um as I say you know going all the

1638
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,120
way back to those very early days

1639
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,199
walking a bar with Brazilian kids on the

1640
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,040
beach playing football you know do think

1641
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:51,799
that gives you a good understanding of

1642
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,040
humans though that we are actually all

1643
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:55,679
good because you've touched on a lot of

1644
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,719
different places and different people

1645
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,679
cultures and backgrounds because like

1646
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:01,400
you said British through and fr is just

1647
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,159
been we spoke about the Americans

1648
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,920
they're very patriotic like World War 3

1649
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,880
stats you have the majority of them

1650
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,360
signing up because they love America I

1651
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,239
mean they sing their National Anem

1652
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,480
there's Pride with them Britain I'm not

1653
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:18,000
so sure I don't know I genuinely don't

1654
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,040
know if maybe I'm wrong I believe we're

1655
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,239
still a very strong Nation I don't think

1656
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,719
we like to profess ourselves to be

1657
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:27,679
British do we I mean we we we much

1658
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,920
prefer to to sort of hide all that and

1659
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,960
just get on with it you know I mean I I

1660
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,600
I do agree with

1661
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:38,040
you you I've worked closely with with

1662
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:40,880
Russians and and I mean Russians in in

1663
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:43,360
in particular and and uh got on with

1664
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,480
enormously well of course one part of

1665
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:49,040
your brain is saying yeah well okay fine

1666
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:52,199
I've got to be careful about this um

1667
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:54,679
but they're human beings just like us

1668
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:57,520
and if you don't talk to them you're not

1669
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:59,520
going to break through barriers I mean I

1670
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,679
I I look at the situation we have at the

1671
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,640
moment with

1672
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:05,600
Putin who's incredibly dangerous and we

1673
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:08,000
we have to do absolutely everything we

1674
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,600
can to keep him at Bay and to keep the

1675
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,920
ukrainians fighting and and give as much

1676
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,840
as we possibly can to the

1677
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,640
ukrainians

1678
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,640
um

1679
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,520
but there are Russians here that want to

1680
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:25,679
be

1681
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,880
here I think we can perfectly easily

1682
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:30,719
chat to

1683
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:33,560
them get with them there are Russians in

1684
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:36,640
Russia who don't want the life that they

1685
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,080
have and I think by any extent possible

1686
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,760
we should try and reach out to them

1687
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,880
incredibly difficult because of media

1688
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:45,400
shut down in in in in Russia but I think

1689
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:48,840
that

1690
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,159
uh rather than sort of caning each other

1691
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,920
and non platforming each other over here

1692
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:55,920
we might sort of start thinking about

1693
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:59,199
what we could do about talking

1694
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,679
to Russians and discuss what democracy

1695
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:03,840
might be to them as aart from us I mean

1696
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,320
I think they must look at us thinking

1697
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,400
here you talk about free speech and yet

1698
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,760
you don't allow people to come and speak

1699
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,800
their minds I mean I'm not talking about

1700
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,920
criminal it you know people being going

1701
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,520
off the deep end

1702
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,560
extremists uh they must find that really

1703
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:23,159
rather odd I think what happened with

1704
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:25,920
Ukraine and Russia what's how did it all

1705
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:28,560
start space

1706
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,320
because obviously crime both what about

1707
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,560
NATO as well was that going closer to

1708
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,840
Russia or was that an excuse to

1709
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:41,639
then Target Ukraine I I I don't think so

1710
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:45,800
I think Putin was in deep trouble

1711
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:48,040
economically um at home and he he wants

1712
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,040
to expand I mean there's no doubt about

1713
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,800
that and this is to the glory of

1714
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,679
Imperial Russia isn't it I mean he's

1715
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,400
gone back there when you talk about

1716
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,199
expan you're talking about Hitler trying

1717
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,199
kind of take over the world is that a

1718
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:02,760
possibility where World War I can start

1719
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:05,080
if how and how sorry two questions but

1720
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,840
how bigger is Russia Russia with China

1721
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,120
because that's two powerful forces as

1722
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,400
well can they be stopped if they come

1723
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,480
close

1724
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:16,480
together well again I mean I don't have

1725
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:18,239
any answers to that I one looks back at

1726
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,679
China Russia relations and they've

1727
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,880
always been up and down have they yeah I

1728
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,480
don't really know I'm just going for

1729
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,679
what I'm seeing they've always been up

1730
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,480
and down yeah

1731
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,440
um and and again I mean I think we can

1732
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:34,600
frighten ourselves to death I think I

1733
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:37,199
think we need to keep we need to keep in

1734
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,199
mind the fact that we need to be strong

1735
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:41,800
and that means money for our Armed

1736
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:46,040
Forces but that's got to be

1737
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:49,480
done um and for the intelligence

1738
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:51,440
agencies uh and on the other hand I

1739
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,719
think we need to remember that hearts

1740
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:58,280
and Minds is just as important as going

1741
01:13:53,719 --> 01:14:00,679
to war you've got to reach out uh to to

1742
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,480
people yeah that interview was

1743
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:04,280
fascinating with Putin he did say that

1744
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,280
he wanted an agreement everybody sat

1745
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:09,199
down ready to sign it him and zinski and

1746
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,040
it was America who says

1747
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:15,159
no it so he says but again you I don't

1748
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,520
know I don't know I'm not intelligent

1749
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,760
enough to have the answers I can only

1750
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,920
listen to people and go well it makes

1751
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,400
sense but again Ukraine would have they

1752
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:26,679
had 50 billion 100 billion like when

1753
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,480
does it ever stop for

1754
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:30,120
peace do you think there would ever be

1755
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,679
peace because there's always was David

1756
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,800
from the patterns that I see in the

1757
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,159
books that I read there's always Wars

1758
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,960
there's always chaos there's always

1759
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:38,159
destruction and do you ever think there

1760
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,600
will be peace on Earth where people

1761
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:41,639
don't need to

1762
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,480
fight or do you think that's just part

1763
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:45,280
of human beings I think it's part of

1764
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,080
human beings I think it goes back to

1765
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,040
what we were talking about earlier genes

1766
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,639
and DNA you know there will always be

1767
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:53,199
greedy people there'll always be people

1768
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:55,159
who want to be more powerful than others

1769
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,080
something we have to put up with do you

1770
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:58,440
think that's what it comes down to

1771
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,440
greeding

1772
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:05,600
power it's sad but it when human beings

1773
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,800
lose lives and like you've probably seen

1774
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,159
and heard and you've been under it where

1775
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:14,440
you've seen people things that the news

1776
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:17,760
don't put on or they they don't print

1777
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,880
but again is it all about peace and love

1778
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,520
I don't know but if you go back to the

1779
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,560
scriptures thousands of years it's

1780
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,840
always been destruction it's always been

1781
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,880
power it's always been

1782
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,800
people trying to take control what does

1783
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:34,679
that come down to is that ego is that

1784
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,679
Madness in the mind again we come back

1785
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:40,120
to the DNA thing where it's just a

1786
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:42,440
natural thing for people to try and

1787
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,840
Lead yes I think it comes down to

1788
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:47,800
thinking you are right I am right I

1789
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,560
think you know we're seeing that and I

1790
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,320
know I go back to

1791
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,320
this cancelling people out and non

1792
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:57,120
platforming that's done because people

1793
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:59,800
think I am right this person doesn't

1794
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:03,440
have a view well that's exactly what

1795
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:06,120
leads to war and and unhappiness what do

1796
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,800
you think of Israel and

1797
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,520
Palestine incredibly difficult I I mean

1798
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:14,400
if you look at the balance of Rights

1799
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:16,920
there uh the

1800
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:19,480
um Israel obviously has the right to

1801
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:23,199
self-defense must do and that's got to

1802
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:26,239
be looked at in the sense that um

1803
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:29,320
Hamas of

1804
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:34,199
the Crader of Hamas is the elimination

1805
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:37,560
of Israel and everybody in it so you you

1806
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:39,440
start from that aspect and then from

1807
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,280
your Hamas point of view you're looking

1808
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:45,440
at Israel that's creating difficulties

1809
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:50,320
in the West Bank you know trying to grab

1810
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:52,040
land and um their view going going all

1811
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,159
the way back to the beginning that

1812
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,840
Palestine should never have been split

1813
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,840
up

1814
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,360
I don't have any truck with terrorism

1815
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:05,360
because that's not a solution to

1816
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:10,199
anything um as far as Israel is

1817
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:13,199
concerned the Hamas have a right to life

1818
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:16,760
um but that right to life is is forfeit

1819
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:20,920
in C in in in circumstances where it's

1820
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:23,400
um necessary to defend yourself and your

1821
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:26,840
reaction on your actions against the

1822
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,840
terrorist are proportionate

1823
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,120
so that's the balance that that Israel

1824
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:34,840
have to look

1825
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:38,040
at the the the huge difficult question

1826
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:41,600
these days is that armaments and things

1827
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:43,480
are are are directed at specific targets

1828
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:47,960
but you do have this collateral damage

1829
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:50,960
which is a horrific thing to to look

1830
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,480
at I don't know the answer and I think

1831
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,080
the only people who would know or would

1832
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,880
be able to reach some answer are those

1833
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,280
people actually on the

1834
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:02,920
ground looking at what's going on from

1835
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:08,159
an independent

1836
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:09,800
perspective um UN in in in in particular

1837
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:12,080
Because unless you're on the ground and

1838
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,920
you know exactly what's going on you you

1839
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,679
can sit in an armchair and prosze and

1840
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,520
and talk about these issues but you

1841
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:21,840
won't reach proper you won't reach what

1842
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:23,239
I would consider a fair conclusion who's

1843
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:28,040
Britain's biggest

1844
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:30,960
threat Russia is it could they how have

1845
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,159
they got a lot of nuclear weapons Russia

1846
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,800
yes of course what happens if people

1847
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:37,440
just started is that a possibility or is

1848
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,520
it a lot

1849
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,080
more where people can't just press

1850
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:45,040
buttons and start firing missiles like

1851
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:48,080
could that happen or is that farfetched

1852
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:51,880
well I went through you know the era of

1853
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,239
uh of um the Cold War you know where

1854
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,880
where that threat

1855
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:59,280
existed uh I think I think the The View

1856
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,400
that I took then and I still take is who

1857
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,760
really wants to set off a nuclear war

1858
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,639
when you know you're going to be wiped

1859
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,880
out

1860
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:10,000
yourself so it's suicide

1861
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,239
basically is there intelligence for

1862
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,719
people to see missiles coming from a

1863
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:17,560
distance or can missiles fly under the

1864
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:20,440
radar with some special airplanes that

1865
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,760
can fly under the radar um but I don't

1866
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:25,480
know about m l say I genely don't know I

1867
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:28,560
don't know enough about that so see when

1868
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,639
you're working MI5 MI6 like is every day

1869
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:34,560
just a a New Day a different day yes

1870
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:36,560
yeah absolutely I mean you can be you

1871
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,320
you'd start off with a wash up with with

1872
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,760
the lawyers um working out what they're

1873
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:44,639
doing and um getting their advice as to

1874
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,000
what might happen or or talking through

1875
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:48,320
cases talking through legislation

1876
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
talking through the balance of Rights

1877
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:54,800
and you might be off to talk to um a

1878
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,120
team of officers about a particular

1879
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:01,679
operation how it might be working out

1880
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:04,920
and um trying to help them out uh then

1881
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:06,960
you might be going off to one of the

1882
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,920
Department's home office or foreign

1883
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:12,000
office to talk

1884
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,800
about working out how how to create

1885
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
legislation for some particular aspect

1886
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,600
for instance running informance which is

1887
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,960
very very tightly

1888
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,199
controlled uh then off to the director

1889
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,920
of public prosecutions to talk about a

1890
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:29,760
prosecution that might be going on on

1891
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,960
yes I mean it it it was very interesting

1892
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,719
see if there's no intelligence like MI5

1893
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:37,080
MI6 CIA do you think the world would

1894
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,760
been more tmil than what it is yes yes

1895
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:43,320
is of course yeah how important is it to

1896
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,880
have intelligence around the world I

1897
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:49,679
think it's absolutely vital one one has

1898
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:52,199
to know as far as one possibly can what

1899
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:55,840
the bad people are

1900
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:57,360
doing do you get like a script of

1901
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,920
someone how does it work so see you've

1902
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,840
got some new te group that's starting to

1903
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,159
you just get wind of that and see if

1904
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,400
you're reading about someone and their

1905
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:07,920
plans to come like who my method of

1906
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,600
thinking how you could come to anywhere

1907
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,800
and hurt innocent children or hurt

1908
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,600
people and blows up and it it it does

1909
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,600
puzzle me that how brainwashed you can

1910
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,159
be like see when you're getting that

1911
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,960
intelligence of people want to do that

1912
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:22,560
and

1913
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,760
kill innocent people kill your own what

1914
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,280
what do you think then does that make

1915
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,800
sad to the world is it just a case of

1916
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,080
you're trying to be cold towards it like

1917
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,440
you says to find the balance of you're

1918
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,199
just doing a job because then you've got

1919
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,600
grandkids you've got kids yeah they be

1920
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:37,080
anybody that hurts my kids I know I

1921
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,120
would die for them I would kill for them

1922
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,719
it's it's not big man talk it's just

1923
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,360
natural but as a any father or any man

1924
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:44,719
should be a protector but see when

1925
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,560
you're Gathering that information of

1926
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,760
people want to hurt your own how how do

1927
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,000
you deal with

1928
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,679
that well the the first thing you have

1929
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,400
to do is if if you get wind of of

1930
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:59,080
somebody a Target which you call a

1931
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:01,760
Target uh then you you have to look into

1932
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,239
that particular snippet of

1933
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,760
information before you even make up your

1934
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:09,280
mind that this is a firm Target you have

1935
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,960
to get collateral information so that

1936
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,760
you can cross reference it to make sure

1937
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,679
that this person is actually somebody

1938
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:19,280
who who may very well be

1939
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:23,040
bad um so therefore it's going to be

1940
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:25,880
necessary to look into them then you

1941
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,239
have to work out well how bad are they

1942
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,920
what what's proportionate you know do we

1943
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:35,520
tap that telephone do we do this all

1944
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,520
that uh and the case is built and and it

1945
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,000
takes

1946
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,480
time so as everything precise where it

1947
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,360
takes time you don't make decisions

1948
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:46,520
straight away no it's very very precise

1949
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,840
very very well closely planned yes you

1950
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:51,000
don't go off half coock like James Bond

1951
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,560
rushing off into the blue with your

1952
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,719
Walter PPK knocking off the Buie that's

1953
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,040
what a little guy from the CIA says he

1954
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,280
says it's not like us [ __ ] drinking

1955
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,080
martinis and stand them with suits on

1956
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,000
they're dressed like little nerds and

1957
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,159
the standing places just gathering

1958
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,679
information for months at a time

1959
01:23:07,159 --> 01:23:11,639
isolated away from everybody nobody

1960
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,480
knows nothing see when you're doing that

1961
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:16,920
job as well if you got to do you judge

1962
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,239
people do you get taught how to look at

1963
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,320
people's

1964
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:23,760
mannerisms the officers do it's all part

1965
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:26,040
of the training and training is massive

1966
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,639
uh I mean that constantly in training

1967
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,040
are you learning every day all the

1968
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:32,480
officers learning every day learning

1969
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:35,400
every day are these guys trained to CO

1970
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,719
as the SCS guys involved as well like

1971
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:40,679
people who get sent off secret missions

1972
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:43,600
people who are top of the tree well the

1973
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:45,199
the um I mean SAS is are sort of

1974
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,679
different different yeah yeah yeah I

1975
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:49,639
mean that their training is is obviously

1976
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,600
different they don't like have nothing

1977
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:55,280
but respect for what these guys up here

1978
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,440
is different the way they handle things

1979
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,920
the way that they've seen things and how

1980
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,679
cold they are like that's I know a lot

1981
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,480
of people can struggle with PTSD and but

1982
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:06,760
these guys are born different do you

1983
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,440
think a lot of people are born to be

1984
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:12,480
like that to be trained and giv orders

1985
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,920
to then go and do anything or do you

1986
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:18,639
believe you can be trained into being

1987
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:22,120
something like that no as like I say I I

1988
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:23,120
think it goes back to DNA you think so I

1989
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,199
I

1990
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:29,679
do um

1991
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:31,719
I I think yes they're special

1992
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:34,120
people that's why they call it special

1993
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:36,560
forces and it they when you do the tests

1994
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:38,800
and that and a lot of these boys it's

1995
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,679
not the big strong men who who finish

1996
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,719
first they tend to see they the ones

1997
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:46,880
that broken it do you think it's more in

1998
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:48,280
here oh yeah I mean you know I mean you

1999
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,400
look at the agencies and there are

2000
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:53,040
people with first class degrees you know

2001
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,639
they'll go out meeting agents you know

2002
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:57,960
is it see is it that MI6 B in there the

2003
01:24:55,639 --> 01:25:00,239
Big Green yeah that's that's the MI6 is

2004
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,040
that where you you went in and worked

2005
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:06,480
yeah I I used to work but from both cuz

2006
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:10,000
CU Mi other side of the the temps what's

2007
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:11,480
it like walking in does it does you just

2008
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,119
love what you

2009
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:17,960
done when I first when I I just become

2010
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:20,320
the know what wear off when when MI5 set

2011
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,000
up their building across the temps cuz

2012
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,920
it was a new building we used to work in

2013
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,920
another building and I I went in for the

2014
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,239
first time time and they had the new uh

2015
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,639
security cubicles you walk in and the

2016
01:25:29,239 --> 01:25:33,800
door closes behind you and won't open up

2017
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:36,760
until you're let through it wouldn't

2018
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:39,480
open up I said Why didn't it open up

2019
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,480
they said you're too

2020
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:47,199
heavy so they slightly recalibrated

2021
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:50,960
that because you what you about sex3 sex

2022
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:53,520
I was 63 yeah he shrunk real old day I

2023
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,560
sh is there a lot of stuff that we don't

2024
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,199
see on news and the newspapers that we

2025
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,199
don't hear that a lot of these people

2026
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:02,440
stop the intelligence that you never

2027
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:04,159
hear about of course you see absolutely

2028
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,119
minimum amount do you look at the

2029
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,480
average person guy like myself or people

2030
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:10,199
who just walk about the street who are

2031
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:11,800
oblivious and sometimes maybe envious

2032
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:14,080
because they don't actually know what's

2033
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,239
going on or would you do you just think

2034
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:19,159
okay that was just the job that you took

2035
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:21,960
on I think I'm un imaginative I didn't

2036
01:26:19,159 --> 01:26:25,000
doesn't strike me like that at all no I

2037
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:28,880
mean I I one of the things 's privileged

2038
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,159
to work with the officers themselves I

2039
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,679
mean that that's

2040
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:36,719
huge I think one's lucky to be all have

2041
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:39,360
such an interesting job um but

2042
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,040
then hopefully you know I mean a lot of

2043
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,520
people are unlucky they don't have

2044
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:46,920
interesting jobs but you have a

2045
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,520
fascinating job I love my job I mean you

2046
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,600
mean yeah ab and you're incredibly good

2047
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,040
at it thank you I mean I have to think

2048
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,520
quite a lot when you ask these questions

2049
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,040
yeah because I don't want to ask I'm not

2050
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,360
going to ask silly questions I know I'm

2051
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,040
not going to get the answers for but I

2052
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:01,199
want to ask enough where people can get

2053
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,639
adjust of what goes on do you know what

2054
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:05,199
I mean I don't trick people up and ask

2055
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:07,280
stupid questions whe there's going to be

2056
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:08,960
Vital Information given away with some

2057
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,719
Russian spy watching this or whatever do

2058
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,040
you know I mean and you'll be on you'll

2059
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:15,880
be on at 1 million per anyway you would

2060
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:18,440
have read me at te and understood me

2061
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:21,679
anyway no you you yeah you've made a

2062
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:24,639
very good Agent Runner if I

2063
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:26,760
say [ __ ]

2064
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,679
and give me a few quid listen I'm all

2065
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,239
yours because police officers have said

2066
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:33,280
to me you'd be a [ __ ] great police

2067
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:36,239
officer you would absolutely that

2068
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:38,280
friendly environment just yeah in fact I

2069
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:39,960
might follow you after this and see if

2070
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:43,000
you go into the six

2071
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,920
building is H but it's just interesting

2072
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,600
how everybody's got different paths in

2073
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,600
life yes and like you say the people who

2074
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,239
just walk along the streets people can

2075
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,360
only gather information from what you

2076
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:54,800
see online on the news but it's not

2077
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,159
really real either because everything

2078
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,560
can manipulate things and we do know

2079
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:00,679
they tell lies now but a lot of people

2080
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,719
you've worked firsthand you've seen

2081
01:28:00,679 --> 01:28:05,239
Terror attacks like you say you got Hur

2082
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:07,119
by it because partly the people in there

2083
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:08,360
will probably blame themselves because

2084
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:10,600
they'll feel as if they never done their

2085
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:13,560
job to 100% they've saved lives but they

2086
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:15,679
save lives every other day yeah they do

2087
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,440
you know what I'm saying but again how

2088
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,360
is so when you see a t attack like and

2089
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:24,480
it does happen when was it last when was

2090
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:26,960
it 77 M for the big one yeah and was

2091
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,560
Manchester Manchester oh yeah and they

2092
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:32,760
try to do Glasgow yeah [ __ ] try to do

2093
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:34,440
Glasgow Airport yes yes and you see the

2094
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,960
people affected not only the people who

2095
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:39,239
have been killed and injured but you

2096
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,000
know the families and as I said earlier

2097
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:43,719
that there's a pretty desperate feeling

2098
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,840
in the in the agencies at that time you

2099
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:47,600
know how was it feeling now cuz when I'm

2100
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,480
in London I was always a feeling of an

2101
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,440
ease here I don't know if that's just me

2102
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,280
but I always feel as if I always

2103
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:56,480
bordering something BR you come from

2104
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:59,360
glasow EXA I should be a walk that

2105
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,960
should be like sunshine and peace down

2106
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:04,239
here but I just it's just I don't know

2107
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,880
man it's always an uneasy kind of

2108
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:07,080
environment sometimes I used to love it

2109
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,520
down here but I just feel as if there's

2110
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:12,000
something Brewing um I get the same

2111
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:17,239
feeling in Bill fast as

2112
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:19,800
well B fast I the one good thing is that

2113
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:21,320
that um you know they they've got

2114
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:24,920
together again at storm on I think

2115
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:26,520
that's brilliant really brilliant and uh

2116
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,119
you know one just hopes they don't get

2117
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,960
hung up on on unification of course

2118
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:32,920
that's out there you know to be

2119
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,840
discussed and all Earth but really and

2120
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,560
truly you know there's a lot of work

2121
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,520
that needs to be done in schools and

2122
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,880
hospitals and all the rest of it in in

2123
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,320
Northern Ireland they're good

2124
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,840
people love I've Got Friends in both

2125
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,880
sides and I'm not that's not my field

2126
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:52,400
I'm a scotman but I just love because

2127
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:54,840
they it's m it just breaks your heart to

2128
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,320
see them fight against each other but

2129
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,119
both wanted to fight and that's

2130
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:00,159
ingrained in the Irish like they are

2131
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:02,280
tough bastards man they're lovely

2132
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:03,920
[ __ ] tough they all tough for the

2133
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,719
grandparents to the kids like they're

2134
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,960
just there's so like we talk about the

2135
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:09,440
DNA there's definitely something in our

2136
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,760
DNA they're just strong if you're going

2137
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:16,719
to war you would want Irish with you

2138
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:19,199
because you do yeah that I I I I do have

2139
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,280
gosh I love the Irish yes yeah I don't

2140
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,320
understand the [ __ ] what they say

2141
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,760
they probably saying the same about me

2142
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:28,520
but they're just something about

2143
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:31,760
some they're wild different yeah but

2144
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:34,040
they get on with life too you know I I I

2145
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:36,600
think they've got a massive future

2146
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:38,280
whether together or apart you know it's

2147
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,679
that's up to them yeah hopefully and

2148
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:41,639
hopefully everything stays peaceful

2149
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,719
there so so yes so see you're in that

2150
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:46,040
job then like I know we T we touch on

01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:47,800
human trafficking now how big is human

2152
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,840
trafficking people say now it's now took

2153
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:52,239
over the drug trade I don't know in

2154
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,080
terms of that statistic but it is huge

2155
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:56,119
of course and there's so much money to

2156
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,920
be made out of it and and you know

2157
01:30:56,119 --> 01:31:00,760
underneath the human trafficking there's

2158
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,480
all the rest of it you know prostitution

2159
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,600
and child trafficking and all the rest

2160
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:08,000
of it is pretty horrific harvesting the

2161
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:11,320
the organs so how as a grand as a father

2162
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,440
yourself and grandfather how was it bad'

2163
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:17,880
7s ' 80s because it just seems to be

2164
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:20,480
more popular now of how luxurious how

2165
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:21,840
luxurious the this business in trade

2166
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,320
actually is because there's millions of

2167
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:26,520
people going missing every year and like

2168
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:28,080
you say it's not just prostitution it's

2169
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,840
they're harvesting their their organs

2170
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,400
their heart their kidneys which is big

2171
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,480
on the black market so it's not just a

2172
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,040
case of selling a kilo of coke which

2173
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:38,840
you'll never see again with kids or and

2174
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:40,880
human trafficking it's a revolving door

2175
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:42,920
with the money that you can make yeah

2176
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:46,880
and I think that's interesting because

2177
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:49,480
one talks about countering uh narcotics

2178
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:51,199
and of course you Counter Narcotics and

2179
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:53,119
off they go into human trafficking you

2180
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:54,960
counter human trafficking and off they

2181
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:56,679
go into fraud I mean it's interesting

2182
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:01,639
what a couple of days ago they just set

2183
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:03,719
up the stop um lookout for fraud um

2184
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:05,840
initiative that's just come from from

2185
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:07,159
the government and the police and um the

2186
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:11,800
National Crime

2187
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:16,119
agency that now costs the UK people

2188
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:19,360
about 8 billion a year just fraud

2189
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:22,400
online so therefore we've had to move to

2190
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:25,840
counter that in a big way same with

2191
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,840
trafficking the

2192
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:33,440
the world uh because we no longer have

2193
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:38,679
barriers and we have these things called

2194
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:41,760
um boundaries or or or between

2195
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:44,119
States but you know really forget it

2196
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,920
everything is on the internet now your

2197
01:32:44,119 --> 01:32:49,239
major crimes on the

2198
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:52,679
internet boundaries are are

2199
01:32:49,239 --> 01:32:55,119
porous people can get through them quite

2200
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:59,560
easily uh

2201
01:32:55,119 --> 01:33:02,760
and that is just great for Crime great

2202
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:06,080
for criminals and certainly since

2203
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:08,520
Eastern Europe was let loose you know

2204
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,880
the breakup of the Soviet Empire I think

2205
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,560
there's been a big increase in in crime

2206
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,480
from that what do you think of putting

2207
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,920
borders up where people can't come

2208
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,040
across the waters and just immigrating

2209
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:22,159
and you feel as if there should be more

2210
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,560
to protect your own without because

2211
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:25,199
there's so much D you don't you can't

2212
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,159
just Point pinpoint certain people who

2213
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:29,280
do certain crimes CU every color Every

2214
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:31,280
Nation everybody does crimes in every

2215
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:33,320
country but should there be more borders

2216
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:36,679
and more control of who's coming in and

2217
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:38,840
out no what we need is more cooperation

2218
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:42,560
I mean one of the problems in in five

2219
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:45,600
and six when when I was there was

2220
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:49,280
tracking um terrorists across

2221
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,239
borders and you'd find that uh the laws

2222
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,520
are all

2223
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:55,280
different I mean for

2224
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:58,000
instance you you you can't use telephone

2225
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,639
intercept here to prosecute a terrorist

2226
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,600
you'd go over to Belgium for instance

2227
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:05,800
and you might not be able to use an

2228
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:07,719
agent without disclosing their identity

2229
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:10,560
so all these laws are different and you

2230
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:14,159
are trying to deal with International

2231
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,119
crime and these organizations just take

2232
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:19,119
advantage of it we would actually have

2233
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:21,400
to pinpoint a jurisdiction where the law

2234
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:23,119
worked better for us to prosecute a

2235
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,320
terrorist and actually try and sort of

2236
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:28,119
maneuver them

2237
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:30,840
there than having them prosecuted in the

2238
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:32,760
UK so what should change then should the

2239
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,400
international cooperation so should be

2240
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,239
you think one law kind of one

2241
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,480
understanding of if you should you think

2242
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:39,800
they could use the British law if you

2243
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:42,800
went to another country and say we can

2244
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:44,800
use this law as we British like for

2245
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,719
instance the laws here is are different

2246
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,480
from everywhere else but if you know as

2247
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,119
an international criminal do you think

2248
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,800
there should be a green light to say let

2249
01:34:50,119 --> 01:34:54,119
us charge them with the laws that we

2250
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,520
have in the UK or would that just be a

2251
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:59,400
freefor all for then I a freefor all

2252
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:02,199
yeah I I think it line though isn't it

2253
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:05,000
to then so why does not everybody work

2254
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:07,639
together then is it money or is it what

2255
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,480
is it is involved national pride is that

2256
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:11,960
what it is because listen Britain's

2257
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:14,960
invaded over 90% of the world is are we

2258
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,480
late anywhere have we got a rough

2259
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,040
understanding or do people always try

2260
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:23,280
and feel as if try to take from

2261
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,199
them well it it it's really curious I

2262
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:27,000
remember

2263
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:30,159
one of the things that that we used to

2264
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:33,719
um love doing was operating in France or

2265
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:35,880
Belgium or somewhere like that because

2266
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:37,800
overseeing this difficulty that I

2267
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,960
explained earlier about converting

2268
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,760
intelligence into evidence to use in

2269
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:47,199
court MH in France but say particularly

2270
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:49,600
France we used to go to um a guy called

2271
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:53,040
the examining

2272
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,719
judge and we could go to him and he

2273
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,719
would we would would give us give him

2274
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,080
all the evidence that we had all the

2275
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:01,119
intelligence we had and he would sift

2276
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,600
through it as we were going through the

2277
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:06,440
operation and he would tell us at that

2278
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,880
particular Point yes you can use this

2279
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:10,639
evidence to go to trial no you needn't

2280
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,400
use that evidence because it's not going

2281
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,880
to help the defense so instead of us

2282
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:17,960
guessing or trying to anticipate what

2283
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:19,719
the court would do this guy would

2284
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:22,840
actually tell us as we went

2285
01:36:19,719 --> 01:36:25,360
along exactly how the trial would

2286
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,800
progress does that make sense yeah I

2287
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:30,239
thought everybody would be working

2288
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:35,280
together though H when I suggested this

2289
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:37,320
to uh an MP who I won't name he said you

2290
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:39,239
know he said if you suggested that we

2291
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:41,800
use the French system in the United

2292
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:44,600
Kingdom you'd hear the laughter from

2293
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,600
parliament in

2294
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,159
Paris that's the sort of attitude one

2295
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,760
has to fight against that's [ __ ]

2296
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:54,000
strange I thought everybody would be

2297
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,400
controlled by the same organized I

2298
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,400
thought it would be one person calling

2299
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:00,080
the shots from everywhere I thought the

2300
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:03,040
borders and all that [ __ ] was just

2301
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:05,040
all an exaggeration of oh yeah there's

2302
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:07,719
politics and people this but that

2303
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:09,159
actually happens there is and that's why

2304
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:10,600
you know I said earlier sorry I didn't

2305
01:37:09,159 --> 01:37:12,360
mean to yeah know that's fine that's why

2306
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,800
I said earlier you know no it's not a

2307
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:16,880
question of borders it's a question of

2308
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:19,000
smashing them down so that's so there's

2309
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,000
a lot of things that there so much red

2310
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,239
tape for people to then make moves on

2311
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,760
certain things because of pride of no

2312
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:27,360
you're not getting in

2313
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:30,239
or your legal system isn't as good as

2314
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:31,760
our legal system you know it it it's all

2315
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:33,679
that see that's why I thought they had

2316
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,639
the secret meetings to say okay this and

2317
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:37,239
that so I thought everything would have

2318
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:39,239
been not a free-for-all but an

2319
01:37:37,239 --> 01:37:41,320
understanding okay just go and get them

2320
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:42,920
so they can actually stop you from going

2321
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:45,320
in and working there as

2322
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:48,440
well well you I

2323
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:51,119
mean at the agency level and the police

2324
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:52,960
level there's cooperation it it it's at

2325
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,960
the legal level that one gets the

2326
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,560
problems

2327
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,760
mhm uh the law level legislation level

2328
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,639
see I thought it would have been some

2329
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,360
European courts or some system to say

2330
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,400
listen let them in there' have been

2331
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:06,719
people higher up just to let someone go

2332
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,760
on with it yeah wouldn't that be good I

2333
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:11,159
thought I genuinely again that just

2334
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,920
shows you the lack of intelligence and

2335
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:15,400
the lack of knowledge that's one can

2336
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:16,800
have to then understand what actually

2337
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,760
goes on in the

2338
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,880
system I think that was probably the

2339
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:22,880
hardest part of my job actually is that

2340
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,960
the most frustra part of the job well

2341
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:28,199
not distress but I think it it was hard

2342
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:31,520
trying to get people to understand you

2343
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:33,119
know in in in the Ministries if you like

2344
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:37,400
or the Departments of

2345
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:40,520
state that uh hanging on to the British

2346
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:44,599
common law in the face of a world which

2347
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:47,159
actually depends largely on on um the

2348
01:38:44,599 --> 01:38:49,880
Civil codes that they that they

2349
01:38:47,159 --> 01:38:52,800
have uh isn't necessarily in our best

2350
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:56,239
interests is Britain still a force oh

2351
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,639
yes yeah still a strong force

2352
01:38:56,239 --> 01:39:00,560
yeah because obviously with the lack of

2353
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,360
funding and I don't know if we got many

2354
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,159
in the militaries we used to have as

2355
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:06,840
well I just know what why why are we a

2356
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:09,400
strong force

2357
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,119
then is that because the intelligence

2358
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,599
obviously the SCS are a strong force in

2359
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:14,119
their own right as well but obviously

2360
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:16,280
lack of numbers when you look at China

2361
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:18,080
and Russia and other countries but why

2362
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:20,560
are we a strong force well special

2363
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:24,080
forces are hugely respected wherever you

2364
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:27,040
go absolutely I mean they are top to I

2365
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:29,360
believe absolutely I've spoke to guys in

2366
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:31,080
the Navy Seals and and they listen I was

2367
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:33,119
always going to be everybody's thinks

2368
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:37,080
are B another but they're the SS are

2369
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:39,400
massively respected they're brilliant uh

2370
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:43,560
the intelligence agencies are recognized

2371
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:44,960
as you know the best I I I'd like to say

2372
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,080
that yeah you're going to say that

2373
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,360
anyway but yeah going to be biased

2374
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:50,840
because you're walk to yeah no I can't

2375
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:54,760
I've got to be

2376
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:56,520
balanced yeah but a balanced view yes I

2377
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:00,360
mean they're they're immensely

2378
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:03,920
impressive um I think also it it it's

2379
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:06,639
that you you you spoke earlier about you

2380
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,159
know are we proud to be British and and

2381
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,239
we were sort of talking about well

2382
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:12,639
actually we we we like to sort of get on

2383
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:15,599
with people on the whole um if anybody

2384
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:17,400
comes and pokes our I will react um but

2385
01:40:15,599 --> 01:40:19,159
on the whole we like to get on with

2386
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,880
people and I think I think the world

2387
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:25,159
generally looks on us as being the

2388
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:28,880
balancers certainly in the EU when we

2389
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:30,599
were there and Dad talk to me about

2390
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:34,159
getting out that's so

2391
01:40:30,599 --> 01:40:37,119
outrageous um we were the

2392
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:39,040
balancers between the various States and

2393
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:40,920
people look to us to do that and they

2394
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,440
still do in the International Community

2395
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:45,320
I me I was in the foreign office going

2396
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:47,800
out on multilateral conferences here you

2397
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:49,679
lots of States um the Brits we usually

2398
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,040
look to to sort of create some sort of

2399
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:53,599
balance mhm so a lot of people would

2400
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:56,800
think the opposite though because we

2401
01:40:53,599 --> 01:40:59,639
have been so ruthless in the past and

2402
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,800
kind of like I say invading over 90% of

2403
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:05,119
the world but it's a strong it's a

2404
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,920
strong [ __ ] Nation it's very strong

2405
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:09,000
and it's it's mad to think because of

2406
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:12,360
the PO the population here it's not that

2407
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,440
big no no no no Ian we do punch well

2408
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:16,440
above our weight there's no doubt about

2409
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,560
that in the International Community so

2410
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:22,000
what again with bre what so you were

2411
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:24,639
against that oh yes I was mad to come

2412
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,440
out of the EU why that

2413
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:30,880
there I think people were

2414
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:34,400
misled they thought we could all go back

2415
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,520
to being this sort of yea nation state

2416
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,280
it just doesn't work in the

2417
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,719
International Community anymore do you

2418
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:41,679
think that's damaging towards the people

2419
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:43,239
in the UK with travel and money and yes

2420
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,080
of course cuz I know all this stuff now

2421
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:46,520
is getting it's more for people's

2422
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,800
businesses aren't the same as well

2423
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:51,000
because stocks not getting delivered on

2424
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,239
time and everything's kind of upside

2425
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,760
down yes I mean if you were in Europe

2426
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:57,280
would you really look to trade with us

2427
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,199
if with all the difficulties if you

2428
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,960
could trade somewhere else easier what

2429
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:03,679
makes the world

2430
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,719
better cooperation

2431
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:09,960
balance meeting up

2432
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:12,360
talking hearts and Minds trying to see

2433
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,880
the other person's point of view try and

2434
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:18,000
to match it to your

2435
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:22,159
own who do you think should be in a

2436
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,679
UK I don't go politics do you not no

2437
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:26,239
why a because you couldn't really do it

2438
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:29,440
if you're working in the foreign office

2439
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:31,360
you had to keep a completely open mind

2440
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,880
yeah you're you're advising whichever

2441
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:35,480
government is there at the day and you

2442
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:38,080
had to keep balanced I keep going back

2443
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:41,400
to that I'm sorry that's that's you're

2444
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:43,000
late them that to stay is that just to

2445
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:45,639
support anything that's happening in the

2446
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,440
UK just to stay just not get involved to

2447
01:42:45,639 --> 01:42:50,080
give to give balance no it's really to

2448
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:54,000
give balance advice I think the other

2449
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:56,639
thing is uh as a lawyer one likes to

2450
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,480
work from Facts

2451
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:02,960
yeah where can you actually get the

2452
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:04,199
facts unless you're operating in in in

2453
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:09,320
the system

2454
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:11,520
itself um newspapers all have a a slant

2455
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:14,760
and you have to sort of try and work out

2456
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:18,599
what what and I prefer to stay out to

2457
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:21,679
stay out of politics and and

2458
01:43:18,599 --> 01:43:24,639
um keep my thoughts to myself would you

2459
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:26,000
have done any job for any 5 M6 well I

2460
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,719
mean you certainly wouldn't do a job

2461
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,679
that was contrary you know that was

2462
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:32,920
illegal yeah of course but can did do

2463
01:43:30,679 --> 01:43:35,199
you is a job for us just to do or can

2464
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:39,840
you reject it if you didn't like

2465
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:41,960
it yeah you could do you didn't

2466
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:45,280
know no I

2467
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:47,599
mean I think the beauty of working with

2468
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:50,199
them is the fact you're working with

2469
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:52,760
people who are

2470
01:43:50,199 --> 01:43:54,520
um who are bright enough clever enough

2471
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,920
and and

2472
01:43:54,520 --> 01:44:00,040
understand um that if you're going to do

2473
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,239
something illegal all you're doing is

2474
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:04,159
Wrecking it you're you're you're just

2475
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:06,599
wrecking your investigation I mean a

2476
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:08,280
because you'll never get it caught B

2477
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:11,679
because you'll be found out and that

2478
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:15,040
undermines the whole of the whole of the

2479
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:18,880
agency um I mean at the time when I

2480
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:22,239
joined uh we had betany who was a spy

2481
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:24,440
who went to the Russians and we had this

2482
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:27,159
idiot Peter who had written a stupid

2483
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:31,360
book that the government tried to

2484
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:33,920
stop this undermined the agency yeah

2485
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:35,719
what happened Peter right what was he

2486
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,520
wrote a book that came he had a bee in

2487
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:41,800
his Bonnet about um some I think it was

2488
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:44,239
Hollis who he thought was a a Russian

2489
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:45,960
spy and he wanted to write a book and he

2490
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:48,159
was told he couldn't so he went to

2491
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:50,239
Australia and wrote it from there and of

2492
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:53,639
course the British government tried to

2493
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:56,040
stop it but when you look at the Peter

2494
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:59,199
right book it was nothing more than

2495
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:02,639
gossip really you he was a strange

2496
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:04,960
person so again I'm surprised again the

2497
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:06,360
British never had P to stop anything I

2498
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,679
thought it know when people get

2499
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:10,599
cancelled or when they can do this and

2500
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:12,480
do that I thought there was so much

2501
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:15,960
power out there that anything could be

2502
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:18,000
got so it surprises me that it was

2503
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:20,000
allowed allowed to release the book in

2504
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,560
Australia where they've just let it

2505
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,280
happen without no ping a plug on it

2506
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,400
that's for me I just everybody Wasing

2507
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,679
together like when you talk about France

2508
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:33,440
and everybody laughing because they

2509
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:35,760
think [ __ ] me British like it's just

2510
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,199
puzzling when again that's how these

2511
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,719
podcasts are important for give people

2512
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:40,480
are understanding it not everybody's in

2513
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,480
agreement with each other no well it's

2514
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,719
was freedom of speech he he was I mean

2515
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:46,480
provided he wasn't actually damaging

2516
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,239
National Security and there was nothing

2517
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:50,119
in that book where you could say it

2518
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:53,320
damaged National

2519
01:45:50,119 --> 01:45:56,199
Security again it was it was on the Cur

2520
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:58,119
of um everything was dreadfully secret

2521
01:45:56,199 --> 01:46:00,199
during the Cold War nothing was ever

2522
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:02,800
talked about nobody talked about MI5 or

2523
01:46:00,199 --> 01:46:06,840
MI6 in those days you know and if you

2524
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:10,119
did you you know you got into trouble um

2525
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:13,199
so the sea change was absolutely massive

2526
01:46:10,119 --> 01:46:15,159
from from um we couldn't even prosecute

2527
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:18,239
terrorists in open court we couldn't

2528
01:46:15,159 --> 01:46:21,000
prosecute terrorists back then before I

2529
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:23,040
joined the agency why because we

2530
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,360
couldn't convert intelligence into

2531
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,800
evidence they didn't have the the

2532
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:29,960
structure to do it they weren't

2533
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:33,880
legislated for how can you go you could

2534
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:34,639
go to a secret Court to prosecute spies

2535
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,880
with

2536
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,880
evidence um but you couldn't go into an

2537
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,280
open court and if you're dealing with

2538
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,960
terrorists it's a totally different

2539
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:45,760
animal to dealing with um spies you must

2540
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:48,080
have an open court if you're dealing

2541
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,599
with terrorism because otherwise you're

2542
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,960
feeding the terrorists everything's

2543
01:46:49,599 --> 01:46:53,760
secret therefore the terrorists say if

2544
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:57,080
it's all secret then obviously they're

2545
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,719
lying but if you go to open court and

2546
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:01,679
prosecute a terrorist and the evidence

2547
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:04,239
is there for everybody to see you're

2548
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:06,679
you're much more plausible as an agency

2549
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:08,679
so we had to change all that what's it

2550
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:11,360
like like working with terrorist what's

2551
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:14,960
it like who's that

2552
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:19,280
feeling that that's done to the officers

2553
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:21,320
I mean that you you just feel here's

2554
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,800
someone

2555
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:25,040
who's doing something something wrong

2556
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:28,560
now we

2557
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:30,840
must try and bring that person to trial

2558
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:34,080
try and convict

2559
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:38,800
them and therefore from my perspective

2560
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:41,080
that was the objective one didn't feel

2561
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:44,159
anything other than this terrorist has

2562
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:45,480
rights therefore I have to respect them

2563
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:48,679
do you respect

2564
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:50,080
them yeah terrorists no no cuz I watched

2565
01:47:48,679 --> 01:47:52,280
an interview and you said something

2566
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:55,520
about terrorists should have rights or

2567
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:57,639
something what was it he says terrorists

2568
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:01,560
terrorists do have rights yeah what sort

2569
01:47:57,639 --> 01:48:04,880
of Rights they have a right to life uh

2570
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:07,360
unless um it can be taken away in terms

2571
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,000
of self-defense rather like Israel and

2572
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,679
and Hamas at the moment they have a

2573
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,840
right to a family life you can't go and

2574
01:48:12,679 --> 01:48:18,000
um do things to their family uh to to

2575
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:21,360
get at

2576
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,080
them um they have a right to free speech

2577
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:26,239
so

2578
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:29,040
providing they're not privatizing

2579
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:31,000
terrorism they can say what they're like

2580
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,199
ex limitations everybody should have

2581
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,880
Free Speech but there's a fun line

2582
01:48:32,199 --> 01:48:37,199
between free speech and hate speech of

2583
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:40,040
course absolutely they can't do that not

2584
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:43,040
at all they have a right not to be

2585
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:45,320
tortured uh and that's where the United

2586
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,159
States went so wrong with water boarding

2587
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:50,520
doesn't do anybody any good anyway

2588
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:52,920
operationally but um you know no

2589
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:56,800
terrorist should be waterboarded

2590
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:59,480
what was that uh when they put into

2591
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,440
water and half drowned in order to make

2592
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:02,679
them

2593
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:04,719
talk yeah I always thought the torture

2594
01:49:02,679 --> 01:49:06,400
tactics was what it was all about if I

2595
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:09,760
was a terrorist I'm think [ __ ] him man

2596
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,080
torture him but it's a that's what I

2597
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,480
thought it was all about I don't know if

2598
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:14,599
that's because of the movies that we

2599
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,760
watch all through the years and we in

2600
01:49:14,599 --> 01:49:18,880
our minds we believe that it's all

2601
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:21,320
what's real yeah but you actually break

2602
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:22,679
it all down we're so far from the truth

2603
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,520
nobody really knows what goes on over

2604
01:49:22,679 --> 01:49:26,719
obviously you'll see enough but you'll

2605
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:29,360
have that much information that you'll

2606
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,760
die with which is a good thing again

2607
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:33,040
because people would be [ __ ] scared if

2608
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:35,599
they actually knew what was going on in

2609
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,239
in the real world do you think fear is a

2610
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:40,080
big part of control on this planet

2611
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:42,159
people can be controlled easily with Fe

2612
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:45,960
yes that's certainly I agree with that

2613
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:49,199
yes yes yes oh blackmail bribery

2614
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:51,960
extortion um yeah and just fear for for

2615
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:55,599
one's own safety yes MH how long did you

2616
01:49:51,960 --> 01:50:00,760
work what the intelligence for uh about

2617
01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:04,960
nine years do you miss it no why well I

2618
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:07,159
I I left um because I thought I'd done

2619
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,960
enough it was a time of massive

2620
01:50:07,159 --> 01:50:12,719
change and I'd got to the point where

2621
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:14,920
the change that I'd

2622
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:16,679
done I suppose again that sounds

2623
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:18,840
slightly pompous but I'd achieved what I

2624
01:50:16,679 --> 01:50:21,440
wanted to achieve there were one or two

2625
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:23,159
other things that I wanted to achieve

2626
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,800
but I saw that I could couldn't because

2627
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:27,480
I wasn't going to persuade people from

2628
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:30,040
within so I came out and persuaded them

2629
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:31,520
from outside with the knowledge that you

2630
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:35,920
have in the Le that you've LED what do

2631
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:38,199
you think life is David I think I think

2632
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:42,000
one one's just got to get on with

2633
01:50:38,199 --> 01:50:45,880
it I I mean some people do have major

2634
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,840
problems o obviously um w w with the

2635
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:50,560
awful things that happened to

2636
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:53,440
them but I think my wife has a brilliant

2637
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:56,239
expression for it um she was at boarding

2638
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,159
school as well from seven years so you

2639
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:59,679
know we

2640
01:50:57,159 --> 01:51:01,920
match you got an understanding of each

2641
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:04,040
other we have total

2642
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,599
understand yeah it's that sort of

2643
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:07,880
boarding school syndrome where you've

2644
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:10,760
got to get on or

2645
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:12,760
die it's like [ __ ] life man like you

2646
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:15,320
say you've just got to keep showing up

2647
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,760
you just got to keep going yes and in

2648
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:18,119
this environment I don't want to bring

2649
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:20,320
people down cuz I've battled mental

2650
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:22,800
health and I've had drink and drugs in

2651
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,599
the past would have escaped but I come a

2652
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:28,000
stage where I done [ __ ] this man I need

2653
01:51:24,599 --> 01:51:31,960
to make changes you said you had escaped

2654
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,840
mhm my view of that is no you didn't

2655
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:37,119
Escape you got yourself together which

2656
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:40,320
takes a huge amount of

2657
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:42,320
Courage I find that impressive I really

2658
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:45,599
do it's the sort of Courage you see in

2659
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:47,960
the sort of agencies you know yeah don't

2660
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:50,159
don't say you escaped you didn't you did

2661
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:53,159
it yourself and that's hugely impressive

2662
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:54,679
yeah I appreciate that no true how how

2663
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:59,079
important is it David to have a good

2664
01:51:54,679 --> 01:52:02,119
woman by your side huge absolutely huge

2665
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:05,119
because they keep you out of the ivory

2666
01:52:02,119 --> 01:52:09,560
tar what I call the ivory tar you know

2667
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:12,800
oh I'm right how me I should change my

2668
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:14,639
name to [ __ ] I Tower that's me I

2669
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,679
think I've got ego I've got [ __ ]

2670
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:19,639
issues where I struggle I think to

2671
01:52:16,679 --> 01:52:21,239
commit if I'm honest I think back in the

2672
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:23,560
days well I think you were married at

2673
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:25,639
1718 and you were free flowing you

2674
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:27,639
worked at it when it was a struggle when

2675
01:52:25,639 --> 01:52:29,440
the [ __ ] hit the fan you spoke it out

2676
01:52:27,639 --> 01:52:31,320
he's maybe had a little argument in time

2677
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,320
to time but you spoke out you didn't

2678
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:35,480
leave everybody's walking away from each

2679
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,000
other now David everybody's soft where

2680
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:38,920
there's no communication that we spoke

2681
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,560
about earlier and that saddens me I

2682
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,520
don't again social media comes into play

2683
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,280
because there's so many options and

2684
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:47,239
we've got screens just for of women and

2685
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:49,159
bikinis and everybody's in contact with

2686
01:52:47,239 --> 01:52:51,159
each other so again for your own

2687
01:52:49,159 --> 01:52:52,840
perspective is for a good woman in life

2688
01:52:51,159 --> 01:52:55,920
do you feel that gives you like you see

2689
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:58,599
balance yes absolutely yeah and and

2690
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,480
she's balanced I mean her her philosophy

2691
01:52:58,599 --> 01:53:03,480
that was taught her by her her head

2692
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:06,320
Mistress of school was life is tough why

2693
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:08,159
should you think it might not be and if

2694
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:11,880
things are hard go and scrub a floor

2695
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:14,800
don't start wallowing in self-pity MH

2696
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:16,800
which I think is a I think those two

2697
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,960
really do help get one through life do

2698
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,199
you think we can feel sorry for

2699
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:23,800
ourselves too much yeah feel as if the

2700
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:25,040
word was against us mhm but you've

2701
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:27,000
actually been to these third world

2702
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:29,239
countries you've seen what real struggle

2703
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,800
is you think we've got it too

2704
01:53:29,239 --> 01:53:34,920
easy no I I

2705
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:37,520
think there are a lot of people here who

2706
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:39,199
really do have a a hard life there's no

2707
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:43,040
doubt about that at

2708
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:45,400
all um the difficulty is trying to see

2709
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,960
how one can help them more you know and

2710
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:49,040
it's not just a question of trucking

2711
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,840
cash at it it's a question of more than

2712
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:54,280
that it's a question

2713
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:56,040
of going out and meeting them and and

2714
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:59,079
and trying to help them their problems

2715
01:53:56,040 --> 01:54:00,880
not that I'm saying that I do that but I

2716
01:53:59,079 --> 01:54:02,840
think that there are people who can do

2717
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,920
that or are really good at it I mean you

2718
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:07,360
yourself reach out to people and and get

2719
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:09,599
them to talk and you get some sort of

2720
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:12,159
understanding of what's going on I find

2721
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:15,040
that very impressive thank you yeah but

2722
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:17,239
I just it's an because um everybody's

2723
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,920
different yes it's an understanding of

2724
01:54:17,239 --> 01:54:20,599
everybody's life whether it's a criminal

2725
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:23,800
whether it's the agent whether it's the

2726
01:54:20,599 --> 01:54:25,440
SCS guy the homeless guy the billionaire

2727
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:27,679
everybody's different because they've

2728
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:29,960
got different levels of trauma but I've

2729
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:32,159
I've spoke to people with 100% worse

2730
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:34,119
trauma than me who are happier than me

2731
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:35,480
as well so everything's to do with how

2732
01:54:34,119 --> 01:54:38,000
you perceive the world and how you want

2733
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:40,880
to make the changes to then be better at

2734
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,880
it nothing changes unless you do no and

2735
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,320
I'm glad you said that because I I do

2736
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,079
agree with that entirely I I think it is

2737
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:49,880
done to the individual and but going

2738
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:51,880
back to it some individuals have it a

2739
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:53,159
hell of a lot harder than others but

2740
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,520
they've created a better future than the

2741
01:54:53,159 --> 01:54:57,400
ones who've not had it hard sure I I

2742
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:00,639
think that's right and as I say it all

2743
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:03,079
goes back to scrubber floor MH you

2744
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:05,000
know just get on with it get on with it

2745
01:55:03,079 --> 01:55:06,840
do something yes that's the for me as

2746
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,880
well for anybody watching or listeners

2747
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:11,599
just show up just push forward whether

2748
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:13,480
it's walking or cutting the Garden or

2749
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,599
painting the house just do something to

2750
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,239
take your mind off of what you're

2751
01:55:14,599 --> 01:55:19,079
struggling with but again A lot of

2752
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:20,119
people are DPP theel into [ __ ] drugs

2753
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:22,800

01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:28,560
potential and everybody's got massive

2757
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:29,760
potential and that's the scary thing

2758
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,320
everybody's got greatness and

2759
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,639
everybody's got something special in

2760
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:34,679
them that they can dig deep and make

2761
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,480
changes and doesn't matter what age you

2762
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:37,920

no and and you're absolutely right

2767
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:51,880
everybody has an ability to do something

2768
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:53,400
and Achieve something whatever it is it

2769
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:55,880

cold country since the last two books

because uh um you know I found that you

2793
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,920
know my granddaughter invited me down to

2794
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:59,520
talk about spies you know I hadn't sort

2795
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:02,000
of thought about much about it and it

2796
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:04,760
was it was at that point you know she's

2797
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:09,679
she's a feisty kid and just reminded me

2798
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:13,679
so much of the uh uh women in in the

2799
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:14,679
agencies you know they are so good that

2800
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,639
sort

2801
01:57:14,679 --> 01:57:20,560
of very talented on the one hand but as

2802
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:24,440
I said you do not want to meet them on a

2803
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:27,920
hockey pitch yeah on the other hand so

2804
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:31,560
yes and we spent sometime Carrie and I

2805
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:34,199
right together wife and uh we'd spent

2806
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:37,840
some time um after the first book which

2807
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:40,560
we published about 15 years ago we got

2808
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:42,960
caught into writing short films

2809
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,079
infomercials for corporations you know

2810
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,599
comedies or

2811
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:49,000
dramas and uh you know sort of thought

2812
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:50,719
well yes that's all great fun but why

2813
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,560
not write a book and that that the

2814
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:54,079
Catalyst was going down to talking to

2815
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,400
these kids at school and they were all

2816
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:58,920
fascinated yeah and you sort of thought

2817
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:01,960
oh yeah CA would be a great and she's

2818
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:04,480
Russian and you know Russians are nice

2819
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,159
people I like Russians yeah yeah like I

2820
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:09,480
see I've come across every culture and

2821
01:58:07,159 --> 01:58:11,280
every basically near every country now

2822
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:14,800
and I've traveled all over the world and

2823
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:16,679
it's I I get on me people no I could sit

2824
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,599
anywhere I could genuinely sit anywhere

2825
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:20,199
and have a conversation and have a laugh

2826
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,880
and I'm surprised because my accent is

2827
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:23,040
so strong I think people may just be

2828
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,360
laughing laughing at the accent and

2829
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,199
thinking what the [ __ ] is this guy

2830
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:28,239
saying but whatever it is it's working

2831
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:29,599
and you have got a fascinating story and

2832
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:31,040
an interesting story with the people

2833
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:33,719
you've worked with the intelligence that

2834
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:35,040
you have of way the world operates and

2835
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:36,440
people are intrigued by it because

2836
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:39,000
there's not many people speak out

2837
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:41,719
against MI5 and MI6 and to get the

2838
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,920

2843
01:58:49,639 --> 01:58:55,400
