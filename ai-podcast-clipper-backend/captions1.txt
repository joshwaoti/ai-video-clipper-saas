A few of you and them actually were

406
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,760

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,039
of madness on them right now in the name

410
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,039

416
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,039
Esther. In fact, the spirit had wanted

417
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,559
to kill her very, very soon. That spirit

418
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,970

457
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,240
I want to take this opportunity to

458
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,280
welcome and honor every servant of God

459
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:20,879

460
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,879

00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:41,320
you. We glorify God for you.

466
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:44,320
Tomorrow I'm going to fly to Dallas,

467
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,119
Texas. So, Saturday we have a conference

468
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:53,399
on Sunday. Monday I should be on my way

469
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:56,159
back because I must be here on Thursday.

470
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,560
Hallelujah. So, I'm going to be there

471
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,040
for only two days. Saturday, Sunday,

472
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,119
back home. I'm not looking for anything

473
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,640
from

474
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,760
America. Hallelujah. Tell your neighbor

475
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,500
poster he's not looking for

476
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,040
anything. He's been given all

477
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,240
[Music]

478
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,599
things. No. Anyway, the only reason why

479
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll come back early is because you

480
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,680
quarrel when I delay. So I don't want to

481
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,560
insult you and hurt your

482
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,560
feelings. My great price is

483
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,880
here. Too bamboo is going to be with us.

484
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,800

[Music]

486
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,680
You can imagine Dr. Cindy Trim is going

487
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,599
to be with

488
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,280
us. You can imagine Apostle Grace is

489
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,960
going to be with

490
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,480
[Applause]

491
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,760
us. I I would not leave myself out.

492
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,280
Oh, praise the Lord. As they've told

people there are people I want to

497
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,359

498
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,119

and I'll get straight into the word

514
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,040
right away. Heavenly Father, we thank

515
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,680
you for the generosity of your people. I

516
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,520
pray that you'll supply all their needs.

517
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,560
all their needs, all their needs. None

518
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,680
will lack, none will want. You'll not

519
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,040
miss any good thing. Even those things

520
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,079
money can can't cannot buy, they come to

521
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,240
you by by that

522
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:17,020
obedience in Jesus name. And all saints

523
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:20,679
said, "Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God."

524
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,679
[Music]

525
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,480
Today I want to preach a sermon entitled

526
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:32,680
The Journey from Promise to

527
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:36,599
Possession. The journey from promise to

528
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:40,839
possession. The journey from

529
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,839
promise to possession.

530
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,880
And I'm going to take

531
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,440
reference from the story of the children

532
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,880
of

533
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,680
Israel and the journey that they

534
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,359
had by the leadership of

535
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Moses in the wilderness because it

536
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,920
echoes our

537
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,240
own personal

538
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,640
experiences of

539
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,480
longing, of

540
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,960
waiting, of ultimately claiming what God

541
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,880
has assured

542
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,240
us. Each one of us here is a traveler in

543
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,800
their own

544
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,680
right. We have questions that sometimes

545
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,680
we struggle to find answers with. We

546
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,560
grapple with doubts sometimes and fears.

547
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,440
We pursue the promises of God. We hear

548
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,200
of the

549
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,160
promises and we get excited when they

550
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,640
spoken before us.

551
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:43,320
But I can tell you a great number of

552
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:46,200
Christians struggle to take

553
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,720
possession of what is

554
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,599
promised. They struggle to make their

555
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,160
own to have a

556
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,520
manifestation of what is

557
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,119
promised. So I want to take you on a

558
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,440
journey. That's why I called it the

559
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,160
journey from promise to possession. It's

560
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,000
not a pilgrimage of

561
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,240
miles. S it's a it's a journey of a

562
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,800
soul. I want to open something to your

563
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,040
spirit tonight that I believe will stand

564
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,520
as a

565
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:18,560
testament to change both your

566
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,599
understanding on how things are

567
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,119
translated to

568
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,440
possession but two that you might also

569
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,920
help

570
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:32,040
others who might be struggling with the

571
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,160
same. I want to give you practical

572
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,079
wisdom and some of the things that I

573
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,359
might share might be obvious to some of

574
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,440
you. You might say, "I think I knew

575
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,640
that. I think I knew that." But I'm

576
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
certain that in there there are things

577
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,720
I'm going to explain that you did not

578
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,720
know or perhaps that you did not know as

579
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,200
you

580
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,680
should. Praise the Lord Jesus. And for

581
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,560
some of

582
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:59,119
you, it's the beginning of taking

583
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,480
possession.

584
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,079
There's nothing as confusing as knowing

585
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,960
that you possess all you have all

586
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,720
things but they are not

587
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,800
manifested. You don't carry the physical

588
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,960
manifestation of these

589
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:21,359
things. The lesson this evening is one

590
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:25,200
of those fundamental wisdoms necessary

591
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,920
to inherit anything that the Lord has

592
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,720
set on our way. In second Peter, of

593
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,599
course, the scriptures tell us, "Grace

594
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,440
and peace, verses two, be multiplied

595
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,720
unto you through the knowledge of God

596
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,440
and of Jesus our Lord." Grace and peace

597
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,280
is multiplied through the knowledge of

598
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:51,280
God and of the Lord Jesus, according as

599
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,800
his divine power has given unto us all

600
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,480
things that pertain to life and

601
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,920
godliness through the knowledge of him

602
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,640
that has called us to glory and virtue.

603
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,920
We have been given everything that

604
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,319
pertains to life and godliness through

605
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,319
the knowledge of him that has called us

606
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,640
to glory and virtue. As we continue to

607
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,359
reveal God, as you continue to know the

608
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,000
person of Christ, you come to the

609
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,480
understanding and appreciation that you

610
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,200
have been given, not will be given, not

611
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,560
might be given, not could be given, will

612
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,680
be given. I mean, sorry, have been given

613
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,560
all things that pertain to life and

614
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,400
godliness through that knowledge of him

615
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,359
that has called you to glory and

616
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,040
virtue. And the n the fourth verse tells

617
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:48,640
us, whereby are given unto us exceeding

618
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,440
great and precious promises. whereby are

619
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,920
given unto us exceeding great and

620
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,560
precious promises. In other words, God

621
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,760
has given you everything that pertains

622
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,560
to life and godliness, but he has

623
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,480
brought it to you, delivered it to you

624
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,880
by the urgency of great and precious

625
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:15,200
promises. So, every promise you have or

626
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:18,880
have found in God is a guarantee of what

627
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,280
has already been given to you by Christ.

628
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,560
Are you hearing me?

629
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,160
And the Bible says, "And by these ye

630
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:32,680
might be partakers of the divine nature.

631
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,200
By these you will participate in the God

632
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,079
life." Did you get it? By these

633
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,280
promises, you will participate. You may

634
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,760
be a partaker of the divine nature, the

635
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,520
God, having escaped the corruption that

636
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,560
is in the world through lust.

637
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,680
So by these

638
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:57,040
promises we claim the life and nature of

639
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,040
God working in

640
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,000
us. So let's go

641
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,200
back because I tell you that every

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
ministry is as fast as its slowest

643
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,440
member. So sometimes it's expedient to

644
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,040
repeat certain things to make sure that

645
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,319
you leave nobody behind. And for those

646
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,000
of you have already gotten the point,

647
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,240
please excuse. Let's go back for some

648
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,520
people who are just

649
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,920
learning even who perhaps have heard

650
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,960
this scripture for the first

651
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:30,040
time. God has given you

652
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,200
everything. How does he get it to you?

653
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,680
By the

654
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:40,119
promises he has made. When you read the

655
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:43,720
promises he has

656
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,240
made, you understand whatever has

657
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,560
been

658
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:51,280
given. And by these promises, you are

659
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,440
made a partaker. You are allowed or

660
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,160
given wisdom and grace to

661
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,520
participate in the that nature of God,

662
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,280
in that life of God, having escaped

663
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,520
corruption that is in the world through

664
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,560
lust. So the promises are

665
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,280
important and what we have been

666
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,359
given is there and it's

667
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:20,240
available. The question is how do we

668
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,240
take possession of what has been

669
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:28,760
given? How do we take possession of what

670
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,760
has been given? How?

671
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,920
If you've been blessed with every

672
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,839
spiritual blessing in the heavenly place

673
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,280
in Christ Jesus, if you've been given

674
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,359
everything that pertains to life and

675
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,440
godliness, right? It

676
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:45,200
means wealth is part of it because you

677
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,200
need money in life, isn't

678
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:54,880
it? And the promises of God in him are

679
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,240
what? Amen to the glory of the father.

680
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,200
Every promise is a finished thing. It's

681
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,920
a finished work. Now ultimately the

682
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,040
question is if you have been given

683
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,880
everything that potential life and

684
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,880
godliness is wealth as part of that just

685
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,880
an example why are you still

686
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:16,480
poor? Health as an example why are you

687
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,480
still

688
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:22,319
sick? Are you following what I'm

689
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,560
saying? Joy as an example why are you

690
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,200
still

691
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:30,480
sad? Favor as an example. Why are you

692
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,480
Why do you look like you're

693
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,599
rejected? Peace and an example. Why do

694
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,599
you Why are you

695
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,599
restless?

696
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:45,920
Hallelujah. He has made promises and

697
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,680
availed everything. Why isn't it working

698
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,440
in your individual life? Well, sometimes

699
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,319
it's not just enough to know the

700
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,880
promises. It's important to cultivate

701
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,079
the

702
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:03,000
wisdom that helps you translate or

703
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:09,119
interpret what God has promised to

704
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,119
manifestation that is possession. Are we

705
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:13,359
following? And I want to take us through

706
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,680
that journey of the children of Israel

707
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,640
as I said earlier in the wilderness and

708
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:23,839
a portion of scripture amazing as can

709
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,599
be. God gives us a very clear answer. So

710
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,800
clear that everybody at the sound of my

711
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,200
voice should

712
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,680
understand how. Praise the

713
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:37,040
Lord. Deuteronomy chapter 1. And let me

714
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,800
first give us a foundation.

715
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,520
This is a time the children of Israel

716
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,200
have have come to the end of the

717
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,079
wilderness experience and are about to

718
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,480
enter the promised

719
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:56,240
land. So Moses gathers them to

720
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,319
instruct to prepare them for the

721
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,079
promised land to remind them of the

722
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,200
things perhaps they have forgotten as

723
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,920
lessons whilst they were on the journey.

724
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,880
things God taught them to ensure that as

725
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,000
they enter the promised land, every man

726
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,920
knows or remembers everything that has

727
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,079
been

728
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,640
instructed through the journey. He's

729
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,599
given them the wisdom to take

730
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,000
possession. Hallelujah.

731
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,079
And the scriptures tell us in

732
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,720
verses

733
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:36,520
21, he said, "Behold, the Lord your God

734
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:42,000
has set the land before

735
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:45,040
you. Go up and possess it. As the Lord,

736
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,280
the God of your father, fathers, sorry,

737
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,680
has said to

738
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:54,079
you, fear not, neither be dismayed. I'll

739
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,040
read that again. Behold, I'm reading the

740
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,800
Amplified. The Lord your God has set the

741
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,200
land before you. Go up and possess it,

742
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,760
as the Lord, the God of your father, has

743
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,520
said to you, fear not, neither be

744
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,200
dismayed.

745
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,400
Somebody say, "I receive

746
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:19,119
it." Now, here in is the

747
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,760
revelation of how to take possession.

748
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,559
This simple portion of scripture has all

749
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,960
the keys that are needed for a man to

750
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,559
take

751
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,280
possession. Beyond the promises God made

752
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,440
to them, now the manifestation of those

753
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,520
promises. And I want to share three very

754
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,119
important

755
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,680
aspects that everybody should know.

756
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,910
Every believer should know if you should

757
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,839
take

758
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:48,480
[Music]

759
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:48,480
possession. This is the

760
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:56,440
season many of us in fact all of us

761
00:48:53,359 --> 00:49:00,160
should be

762
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,520
manifesting showing a difference that we

763
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,240
are children of God and that we have a

764
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,319
covenant with him that separates us from

765
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,079
the world.

766
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:14,760
This is a season, says the Lord of

767
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:17,599
Hosts, where you're going to take

768
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,160
possession, where you're going to see

769
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,760
physical

770
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,319
manifestations of everything God has

771
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,030
promised you in the past. Can you

772
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,880
receive

773
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:31,920
[Music]

774
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,000
it? This is the season.

775
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,359
And so as the Lord was impressing it on

776
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
my heart to share, he said, "Make sure

777
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,079
that you explain it so clear and over

778
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,920
obvious that no man misses what is

779
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,000
happening." This is they are like we say

780
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,000
of the blessing of the Holy Spirit.

781
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,920
There are many things the Holy Spirit is

782
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,920
releasing to us this year. As a matter

783
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,680
of fact, some of us are already

784
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,200
experiencing God like we have never

785
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,720
before. Do I have a

786
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,800
witness? How many of you have seen

787
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,000
unique things? I've had unique

788
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,200
experiences this year than ever before.

789
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,720
Exactly. Praise the

790
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,480
Lord. So, like I said, Deuteronomy 121,

791
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,240
and that's why I'm going to move around.

792
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,559
The instruction was very clear. I just

793
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,720
went on as a light

794
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:23,440
bulb. There are three very important

795
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:26,480
aspects to the journey from promise to

796
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,350
possession. Number one, and I want you

797
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,400
to write

798
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:35,640
[Music]

799
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:40,370
this. Everything God has prepared for

800
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,760
you. He has already laid the

801
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,119
[Music]

802
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,400
groundwork. You should know that. This

803
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,200
is very important for everybody to know

804
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,960
that cuz there are many people who don't

805
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:56,839
know it or who assume to know it but it

806
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,839
is head knowledge. It's not the

807
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:01,040
understanding of the

808
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:03,960
heart. You know it's possible to know

809
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,770
something of head but not have the

810
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,680
understanding of the heart.

811
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:12,240
[Music]

812
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,839
There are people you could try to help

813
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,839
or repeat something and they and they

814
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:18,400
say everything you're going to tell me I

815
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,280
know. But then you ask them if you know

816
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,599
it why isn't it working in your life?

817
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,599
Because sometimes what your mind knows

818
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,599
is not what your heart

819
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,440
perceives. Every man and woman at the

820
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,920
sound of my voice should perceive with

821
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,440
the inner heart. the inner sorry the

822
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,240
inner man with with the inner wisdoms

823
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,240
God has given

824
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:48,760
you the fact that everything God has

825
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,480
given

826
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,839
you he has already laid the groundwork

827
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,200
for you to take possession

828
00:51:54,839 --> 00:52:02,319
of God has already set the stage for you

829
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,680
to enter whatever he has given you God

830
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:09,440
has already made arrangements for you to

831
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:12,400
enter whatever he has given you. God has

832
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,319
already given divine assurance to

833
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,359
everything he has given he has given

834
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:22,040
you. It is imperative

835
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:25,520
that when you are going to enter

836
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,480
something, you should not worry whether

837
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,480
the settings are

838
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:36,119
right, whether everything is in

839
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:40,000
order, whether everything is

840
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:43,400
arranged. Praise the Lord Jesus.

841
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,490
The scriptures tell us, "And then

842
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,079
God created a garden in the

[Music]

844
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:55,319
east. And after creating or making a

845
00:52:51,920 --> 00:53:00,599
garden in the east, the Bible says,

846
00:52:55,319 --> 00:53:00,599
then he took man into the garden.

847
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,880
He makes the garden

848
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:09,720
ready, prepares everything that man

849
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,480
needs and then brings the

850
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,920
man. Yeah. Really Genesis 28. The Bible

851
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,480
says, "And the Lord planted a garden

852
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,800
eastward in Eden, and there he put the

853
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,119
man whom he had formed.

854
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:25,040
He did not take the man into the

855
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,599
garden I mean sorry at the situation

856
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,920
where the garden should be and then

857
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,240
start

858
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,280
creating for the man everything he

859
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:40,240
needed. Are you following the

860
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:41,160
wisdom? He planted the garden eastward

861
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,800
in

862
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,079
Eden. And after planting and putting

863
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,280
everything

864
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:53,800
necessary, man

865
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:57,440
came. He didn't put young

866
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:59,680
plants for man to enter the garden and

867
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,960
then wait for the season for the plants

868
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,160
to grow and give him fruit. He made sure

869
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,440
that everything was

870
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:11,040
planted, achieved its necessary

871
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:14,559
maturity, and then brought man into the

872
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,559
garden. That is

873
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,750
powerful. Everything you enter is ready

874
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,880
for

875
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:28,839

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,839
Everything God has given you is ready

878
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,839
for

879
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,839
you.

880
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:46,520
Everything the groundwork has already

881
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,119
been

882
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,520
met,

883
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:53,920
laid. It's important. Go back to the

884
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,680
scripture in Deuteronomy 1:21. What did

885
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,319
he say? He says, "Behold, the Lord your

886
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:04,200
God has what? Set the

887
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:07,280
land." Set the

888
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:10,079
land. Oh, I think I'm preaching to

889
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:14,440
people in the back. Behold, the Lord

890
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:19,839
your God, the Bible says, he has set the

891
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,839
land. That means he has made it

892
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:28,559
ready. Now in the physical realm your

893
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,559
business might not appear to be

894
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:35,359
ready but in the spiritual God has made

895
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,359
it

896
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,400
ready. Everybody who is supposed to

897
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,079
contribute to that business is

898
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,359
ready. They might not know. Are you

899
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,960
hearing me? But when the time comes,

900
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:55,240
when push comes to show, God will stir

901
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:59,040
their hearts to do what they must

902
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:02,520
do. And yet that's not the time they

903
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:05,359
were ready. God had already made them

904
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:09,359
ready, but they might not know that they

905
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:13,000
are what? They're ready.

906
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:15,079
The shop where you're going to put that

907
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,319
business is

908
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:20,640
ready. God doesn't say, "I have given

909
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:23,119
you the grace to do business." The

910
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,319
language of God is, "Behold, I have set

911
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,319
a business for

912
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,680
you." Now, if you don't understand this,

913
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:39,119
you're going to try to set

914
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:41,559
up instead of entering

915
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,520
what is already set

916
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,359
up. And every time you enter, you try to

917
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,119
set

918
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:51,880
up instead of entering what is already

919
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:55,680
set up for you, you are living under the

920
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,720
law. The Bible says the letter killth,

921
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,920
but the

922
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:03,200
spirit is

923
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,960
life. That's the separation between law

924
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,520
and grace.

925
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,119
Men under the law will never understand

926
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,359
what has been made

927
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:15,400
ready. No man without the revelation of

928
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,799
the doctrine of grace has the

929
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,800
understanding of the power and wisdom of

930
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,000
entering what is already

anything as of to think of anything by

934

us. But our sufficiency is of God, which

935
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:40,340
has made us able ministers of the New

physical, it does not mean that it's not

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:45,040
ready in the spiritual." And it is an

956
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,340
error for you to move by sight and not

957
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,799
by faith.

958
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:51,280
[Music]

959
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,680
When you move by sight, you'll see that

960
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,200
nothing is

961
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:58,400
ready. But the beginning of walking

962
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,640
into, he says, "For we walk by faith and

963
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,720
not by

964
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:05,839
sight." The first steps that allow you

965
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:10,200
to take possession is the understanding

966
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:14,799
that God has arranged everything. It is

967
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,640
ready. It is ready. It is ready. It is

968
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:19,000
ready.

969
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,079
Your womb is ready to

970
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,920
conceive. Are you hearing me? Now the

971
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,839
doctors might say, "Oh, you know,

972
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,119
scientifically you cannot have children

973
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,760
because of blah blah blah blah blah."

974
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:34,599
Whatever they say, you you must see that

975
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,599
it is ready. Hallelujah.

976
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,200
As a

977
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:46,000
minister, you must believe that when you

978
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,119
get an altar, it to an altar, it is

979
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,480
ready for

980
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:52,200
you. You don't go on the altar to

981
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,119
prepare

982
00:59:52,200 --> 01:00:01,000
it. That's a pri priest with

983
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:01,000
infirmity. That's what the Lord does.

984
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,240
You think that there are things you can

985
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,240
do to prepare an altar. Yet, if you

986
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,200
understand how God works, if you

987
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,599
understand the mind of

988
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:15,119
God, you'll understand that the altar is

989
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,880
already for you. The Bible says that the

990
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,319
law maketh men high priests which have

991
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,839
infirmity, men with

992
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,680
weakness, but the word of earth which

993
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:26,400
was since the law maketh the son who is

994
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,960
consecrated forever.

995
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,040
When you come in that understanding,

996
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,920
every time you step on the altar, it is

997
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,599
ready for you. It is ready to receive

998
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:38,119
you.

999
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:40,359
Hallelujah. It honors your

1000
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:42,680
right to

1001
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:45,280
minister. This is

1002
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:48,119
powerful. Somebody say, "Everything that

1003
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,839
God has given

1004
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:54,720

1005
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:55,190

1006
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,760
It's

01:00:55,190 --> 01:01:00,119
[Music]

1008
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:02,640
ready. When you start seeing things

1009
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:05,000
ready, you will be amazed at how quick

1010
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,960
you take

1011
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,960
possession. Jesus spoke to the

1012
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:15,760
disciples. And he asked, he says, "Don't

1013
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,880
you say that there are yet four months

1014
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,760
and then the harvest is

1015
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:25,359
here?" Isn't that what you say?

1016
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:28,559
But you say that because your optics are

1017
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:31,680
blurred. They're blurred. Your vision,

1018
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:36,799
in other words, is not clear. He tells

1019
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:39,520
them, "I said to you, lift up your eyes

1020
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:42,160
and look on the field." The eyes have to

1021
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,640
be lifted. You have to see things from a

1022
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,200
high dimension, a higher dimension of

1023
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,200
sight and where truth is. He says, "Lift

1024
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:53,320
up your eyes and look on the fields for

1025
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,640
they are white and already to

[Music]

1027
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:02,760
harvest." The reason why, take for

1028
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:06,520
instance, a minister, any minister will

1029
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:09,400
struggle with a harvest is when their

1030
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:12,040
heart has not

1031
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,599
understood that the harvest is

1032
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:19,200
ready. And that delusion, that deception

1033
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:23,640
usually takes ministers in the field to

1034
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:26,319
fl to plow where they should be

1035
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:29,359
harvesting. So instead of harvesting

1036
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:30,690
what God has made ready, they plow what

1037
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,359
they should

1038

[Music]

1039
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:37,240
harvest. Are you following what I'm

1040
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:42,119
saying? They plow what they should

1041
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,119
harvest. This is very deep pastors.

1042
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,480
You are plowing in the time where you're

1043
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,160
supposed to be

1044
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,319
picking because you your eyes cannot

1045
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,030
see. They are not lifted enough to see

1046
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:56,040
that the harvest is

[Music]

1048
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:01,079
ready. The Bible tells us that he is the

1049
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,319
God of the

1050
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:09,920
harvest. Isn't it? That is why he says

1051
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:11,720
that the harvest is truly plentous but

1052
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,720
the laborers are

1053
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:18,079
few. He's not saying that the ministers

1054
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:21,120
are few necessarily. No, he's talking

1055
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:25,710
about the laborers who see the harvest.

[Music]

1057
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,520
That's why Paul called some busy bodies

1058
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,760
because they could go in the field and

1059
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,599
they find they cannot see that the

1060
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,880
harvest is ready. So what they start to

1061
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,960
do they start plowing and planting where

1062
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,559
and God is telling them no no no you can

1063
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,520
never plant sufficiency enough for me to

1064
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,520
accept a perfect harvest. Whatever I

1065
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,960
could accept is only that which comes

1066
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:56,000
out of my purity and creations. Instead

1067
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,160
of creating your own kingdom, allow me

1068
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,400
to build my kingdom because this is the

1069
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,400
promise I made. On this rock, I will

1070
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,319
build my kingdom and the gates of hell

1071
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,079
shall not prevail. It's not about you.

1072
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:11,200
It's about

1073
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:13,839
me. When I understood that every time I

1074
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,880
get on the altar, I get on the altar as

1075
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:18,480
a man reaping a harvest. I don't get on

1076
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,559
the altar as a man trying to plow or

1077
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,640
plant

1078
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:23,960
something. And I've

1079
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:27,920
understood

1080
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:33,319
the indifference it takes for a man to

1081
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:36,319
seek to plant his own. Yet God has

1082
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:40,240
already brought a harvest. Why do you

1083
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:41,280
waste time trying to plant where God has

1084
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,079

1089
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,359

1090
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,480
non-believer who is not born again, I

1091
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:56,480

is because they are a

1105
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,559
harvest. They are a harvest.

1106
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:42,720
I see Fero Ministries as a harvesting

1107
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,440
field, harvesting what God already

1108
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,200
planted by

1109
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,920

01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,920
Glory is

1111
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:54,960
ready. So everywhere we go, it's

1112
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:58,480
everything we enter, every season we

1113
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,400
enter, everything we turn to, it must be

1114
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,799
ready.

1115
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,400
So when Jesus walks to a fig tree hoping

1116
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,280
to find something to eat and he finds

1117
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,240
none, he curses

1118
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:10,240
it because it should be

1119
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:16,079
ready. Are you hearing me? It has gone

1120
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,520
away from the natural order of how to

1121
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:22,039
respond to the children of

1122
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:25,520
God. You have the right to curse

1123
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:25,520
whatever cannot

01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,960

You have the

1126
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:39,280
right. Isaiah 45:2 says this. Let's open

01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:44,000

Everywhere you're entering, God goes

before

you to make sure he prepares that man,

01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:11,200
make sure he prepares that hotel, to

1138
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,799
make sure he prepares that company, to

1139
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,440
make sure he prepares the hearts of

1140
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:18,760
people to respond to what's upon your

1141
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,200
life. When you understand this

1142
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:23,200
revelation, your world will become a

1143
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:27,680
wonder. You'll enter an airport and

1144
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,200
somebody will want to bless you. You'll

1145
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,680
enter a supermarket and somebody will

1146
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,680
want to bless you.

1147
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:39,000
There are days some young some people

1148
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:42,000
who are around me notice something that

1149
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,480
99% 98% of the times I enter in a

1150
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,599
restaurant or hotel when I go and tell

1151
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,799
the waiter my bill they say somebody has

1152
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:52,520
paid I said

1153
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:55,680
ah what somebody has

1154
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,680
paid that guy went in a salon to cut my

1155
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,119
hair and this say oh somebody walked in

1156
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,640
and saw you in here and said they've

1157
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,799
paid for you whenever you just want to

1158
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,680
cut hair just

1159
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:07,599
Come. Everything is

1160
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:10,160
ready. Everything is ready. Everything

1161
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,960
is ready. Tell your neighbor it is ready

1162
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,559
for

1163
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,040
me.

1164
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:20,480
But it just didn't

1165
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:25,640
become. I had to see it become. I had to

1166
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:29,120
speak it to become. I had to confess

1167
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,480
it as though it were. Don't miss that.

1168
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,480
as though it

1169
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:36,560
were. So when you're entering a nation,

1170
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,440
say, "Father, I thank you because this

1171
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,440
nation is ready for

1172
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:46,400
me." When you're entering a company, a

1173
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:49,080
business, heavenly father, I thank you

1174
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,239
because you've paved the ways. The

1175
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:55,359
crooked roads are made straight already.

1176
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:58,000
The valleys are lifted. The mountains

1177
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,560
are flattened for me. So I have a free

1178
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,560
course. Nothing is going to interrupt,

1179
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:07,679
frustrate, or intercept my purpose in

1180
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,679
this company. Come

1181
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:15,120
on. Whatever is not ready for me has no

1182
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,120
place here. You'll start to see people

1183
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,199
being fired and resigning. Are you

1184
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,359
hearing me? Why? Because you have you

1185
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,719
you see that it is ready. Tell your

1186
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,640
neighbor, take

1187
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:28,560
possession. Jeremiah 29:11 says, "I know

1188
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,560
the plans." Amplified uses the word new

1189
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,359
living translation says, "I know the

1190
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,679
plans I have for you." God has plans for

1191
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,520
you. You're not a mistake. You know,

1192
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,279
you're not walking in this world like a

1193
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,359
like guesswork. Are you hearing me? He

1194
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,679
says, "I know the plans that I have for

1195
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,279
you." So, he has planned your vision. He

1196
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,120
has planned your business. He have

1197
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,799
planned your children. He has planned

1198
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,040
your marriage. He has planned your

1199
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,719
ministry. He has planned your dreams. He

1200
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,640
has planned your innovations. He has

1201
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:59,040
planned your creations. He has planned

1202
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,040
your your travels. He has he has planned

1203
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:08,600
everything. See, I have set the

1204
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:13,120
[Music]

1205
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:15,560
land. Yes, they enter to plow, but it

1206
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:19,280
was set for

1207
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,280
plowing. Are you hearing

1208
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,960
me? Everything is ready for you.

1209
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,320
Praise the Lord. Number

1210
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,320
two, take

1211
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:40,960
initiative. In other

1212
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:43,280
words, take some action. Let's go back

1213
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,520
to the scriptures. The Lord your God has

1214
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,280
set the land before you, but because he

1215
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,000
has made it ready for you, it doesn't

1216
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,600
mean that you sit back and do nothing.

1217
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,960
What's the next line? Go up

1218
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,560
and possess it.

1219
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,470
Take initiative. Touch somebody and tell

1220
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,520
them take

1221
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:02,840
[Music]

1222
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:06,000
initiative. And there are

1223
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,800
three wisdoms, practical wisdoms,

1224
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,280
finesis. This is

1225
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,360
finesis. Three practical

1226
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:16,159
wisdoms in the realm of taking

1227
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:17,800
initiative. Number one, deal with the

1228
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,480
spirit of

1229
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,640
procrastination. Procrastination is a

1230
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,640
demon spirit. You ask me what is

1231
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,360
procrastination? Procrastination is

1232
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,360
voluntary

1233
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:33,960
[Music]

1234
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:38,440
delay. Procrastination is is

1235
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:41,840
that spirit that makes you postpone

1236
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,430
things. I'll do it tomorrow. Go up. I'll

1237
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,760
do it

1238
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:48,280
[Music]

1239
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,560
tomorrow. Start the business. I'll do it

1240
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:54,100
tomorrow. Register the company. I'll do

1241
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:56,600
it tomorrow. Propose. I'll do it

1242
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:59,000
[Music]

1243
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:02,880
tomorrow. Then before you know

1244
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,880
that, they're announcing

1245
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,239
her. Then you start cursing. Fire, fire,

1246
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:13,950
fire, fire, fire. I cancel, I cancel.

1247
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:17,239
Confusion. Conf. Some fellows are

1248
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:19,679
[Music]

1249
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:21,760
fast. Or rather, some ladies are not

1250
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,780
slow.

1251
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,840
Which is

1252
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:27,080
[Music]

1253
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,640
which? Go up and

1254
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:32,679
what? Tell your neighbor. Do not

1255
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,880
[Music]

1256
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:37,440
procrastinate. Don't postpone things

1257
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,040
you're supposed to do today. Don't

1258
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,880
postpone things you're supposed to do

1259
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,719
next

1260
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,760
week. Everybody at the sound of my voice

1261
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:49,600
should have a to-do list. Putting a time

1262
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,120
frame on it. Are you hearing me?

1263
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,480
By this date, I should have gotten

1264
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,000
married. By this date, I should have

1265
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,360
started this business. By this date, I

1266
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,520
should have built the house. By this

1267
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:02,080
date, I should I should by this

1268
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:04,960
date, if there is a delay, it should not

1269
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,640
be on your side. I understand if you

1270
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,480
took the document and electricity went

1271
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,760
off so you couldn't print, but I have a

1272
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,239
problem when you can't even take the

1273
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,360
document to the printer. That's a demon

1274
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:16,560
spirit. Tell your neighbor that's a

1275
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,040
demon spirit.

1276
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,600
Do you know how many people's destinies

1277
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,600
have been

1278
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,920
misaligned, taken out of course and

1279
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,040
order because of the spirit of

1280
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,360
procrastination. Let me show you

1281
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:37,400
Revelation in Proverbs 6 4 amplified

1282
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:40,400
version. Proverbs 6 4 1 2 3 let's

1283
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:43,400
go. You'll read. Come on. 1 2 3 let's

1284
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,400
go.

1285
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,110
There is such a thing as

1286
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:54,199
unnecessary

1287
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:57,360
[Music]

1288
01:13:54,199 --> 01:14:00,880
sleep. Sleep is necessary, but sometimes

1289
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,880
it goes to the level of

1290
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,360
unnecessary. Give me the message version

1291
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:10,800
of

1292
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:12,120
that. One, two, let's go.

1293
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:18,880
Don't

1294
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:18,880
procrastinate. There is no time to lose.

1295
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:24,760
Don't you as a student, you should know

1296
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,280
when to read your books. Are you hearing

1297
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:30,360
me? Don't start watching movies in the

1298
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:34,159
time when I'll read

1299
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,159
tomorrow. I'll call you

1300
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:40,560
tomorrow. Praise the Lord. Do you know

1301
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:43,640
how many my goodness you see many people

1302
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,520
don't understand this that actually

1303
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,960
procrastination is spiritual

1304
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,840
bondage. Read the next verse. Let's go

1305
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,239
back to probably give me the New Living

1306
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:56,080
Translation. New Living

1307
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:59,520
Translation. Versus 4. Let's move from

1308
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,120
verses 4. Don't put it off like do not

1309
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,840
procrastinate. All right. Don't have

1310
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,520
unnecessary sleep. Amplified said do it

1311
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,679
what?

1312
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:13,040
Don't what until you what you do. Listen

1313
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:16,719
to verse five. Powerful. Save yourself

1314
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:19,120
like a gazelle escaping from a hunter.

1315
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,520
Like a bird fleeing from a net. In other

1316

01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,320
the circles of procrastination, they're

1318
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,320

So when the Bible says do not

1333
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,480

1334
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,640
rebuke that spirit that refuses you to

1335
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,480
get married, that spirit that refused to

1336
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:15,080
you to get a job. But when you ask this

1337
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,080
person, why did you not get that job?

1338
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,880
Some of them will

01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:25,360

1341
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:28,480
date of application was 26th. I took my

1342
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,480
application letter on

1343
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,840

01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:38,320
now? Why didn't you get the job again?

01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,760
Demon spirits. Uh-huh. Which demon is

1346
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,920
that? The demon of what?

1347
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,920
Procrastination. There was something

1348
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,920

1349
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:52,560

sort of luxity on your spirit to delay

1351
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,090

28th. Whatever delayed you for 4 days is

1356
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:12,040
a demon spirit. Those ones inferno, we

1357
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,320

taking initiative is because people

naturally despise small or

01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:20,159

people have not taken the first step

1387
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,480
because they want to take it

1388
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,159
big. You want to build a house. Do you

1389
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,679
know what you're saying? I I want to

1390
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:46,120
save money so that at least I can build

1391
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:49,280
it to the level of the

1392
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:51,840
roof to the beam. That's why I'm saving

1393
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,679
money when I have enough money. No, in

1394
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,440
fact, I want to save money so I can

1395
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,159
build a house to the point where now I

1396
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:01,040
have put a what? I can I can put a roof

1397
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:03,560

1398

1400
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,920
reason is you have peers that are

1401
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:12,520
looking at you who perhaps have done

1402
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,800
things big at a peer

1403
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,040

No, it hits old guys,

1406
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,560
too. My so and so built a five-

1407
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,800
bedroomedroom house and he built it in 6

1408
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,560
months. So and so built a six-bedroom

1409
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,280
house and then and then he built it in 7

1410
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,920

me help some of us. They generation

1413
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,880
should be wiser. There's a difference

1414
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:44,159
between prestige and purpose. You have

1415
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,480
two children. You're building a

1416
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:50,480
20-bedroom house. That's a demon

1417
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,480

children. Two children and you're

1421
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:03,679
building a house of 20

1422
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:08,840

1423
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:11,679

01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,239

silent. True wealth is silent. People

creations. They are strategic. They

1431
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:37,440
plan. Build a four, five bedroomedroom

1432
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,960
house or twobedroom or whatever you can

1433
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:42,159

children to have a decent

1435
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,199

1436
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:50,640
and it's like a

1437
01:20:48,199 --> 01:20:51,800

that

1439

when Jesus had more than enough to feed

1457
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,320

1458

"Collect the

1459
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,679
rest." Because the kingdom of God bears

1460
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,480
the wisdom of not wasting because you

1461
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:52,280

01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:54,880

Ask some of us. My first job paid me a h

01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,320
Move

1677
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,199
on. Every Thursday we are preaching the

1678
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,719
gospel under open

1679
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:22,400
heaven. You think we do not have first

1680
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:24,239
waited to first put a very huge dome

1681
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,520
here to make sure everybody's covered.

1682
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:28,760
Then we start preaching.

1683
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,480
Uh-uh. We just

1684
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,480
went. If the rain

1685
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:38,800
comes, we go through it. We wait up. We

1686
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,800
go. Are you hearing me?

1687
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,080
Do you know how many people have not yet

1688
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:46,320
started?

1689
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:49,639
Sometimes even when they can do big the

1690
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:53,120
conditions, other conditions are not

1691
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:54,880
favorable. Just wait for the right time

1692
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:57,600
and they call it wisdom. You know, it's

1693
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,600
wisdom to do things in the right time.

1694
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,760
But the person speaking you can actually

1695
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:06,080
feel it's proy nation and the right time

1696
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,080
never

1697
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:13,120
comes you know we would get married but

1698
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,120
now I

1699
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:23,239
am the conditions I don't have enough

1700
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:26,360
money. Hey invite 20

1701
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:28,960
people. I'm helping some women

1702
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:31,760
here. If if if you're not ready for a

1703
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:34,159
mega wedding, invite 20 people, you

1704
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,719
know. I want to do it so big. When will

1705
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,719
it be so

1706
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,040
big? Now you're producing with

1707
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:46,080
children and and she's still living on

1708
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,520
hope. Now it's borrowed hope. The

1709
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,170
friends were encouraging her. Don't

1710
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:53,480
worry. If he said he'll do

01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:04,719
Preach the word. Keep your sense of

01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:07,760
what? Agency. Be at what? Hand and

1715
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:11,199
ready. Whether the opportunity seems

1716
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,199
favorable or

1717
01:34:13,719 --> 01:34:18,320
unfavorable. Praise the Lord Jesus.

1718
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,880
Tell your neighbor, don't wait for the

1719
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:23,440
perfect

1720
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:25,520
conditions. They may never come. Yet you

1721
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,900
have to move. Come on, tell them yet you

1722
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,560
have to

1723
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,560
[Music]

1724
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:37,760
move. I want to finish. Let's go back to

1725
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:40,080
Deuteronomy 121. So, we've covered the

1726
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:43,520
two things. The Lord your God has set

1727
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:46,120
the land before you. He tells you, "Go

1728
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,960
up and

1729
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:51,960
possess." And I've explained why people

1730
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:57,080
don't take possession. Number

1731
01:34:51,960 --> 01:35:01,199
three, he said, "Fear not, neither be

1732
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:04,880
dismayed. Refuse to subject yourself to

1733
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:08,360
the spirit of fear and discouragement

1734
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,360
when you start.

1735
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:13,159
I cannot tell you how many people have

1736
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,920
quit on the way because of

1737
01:35:13,159 --> 01:35:16,920
fear. How many people have quit because

1738
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,840
they're

1739
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:23,960
discouraged? Or some have even failed to

1740
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:26,800
start because they just have a spirit of

1741
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:30,480
fear. Joshua 1:9 says, "Have I not

1742
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:33,760
commanded you? Be strong and of good

1743
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:37,040
courage." And he says, "Do not be what?

1744
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:43,040
Afraid nor what? dismayed for the Lord

1745
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:43,040
your God is with you wherever you

1746
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:49,440
go. The Bible says in second Timothy 1 7

1747
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:53,440
if you read the amplified version God

1748
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:56,560
did not give us a spirit of fear, a

1749
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:58,639
spirit of deity. We we were not created

1750
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,440
with a spirit of coward eyes, craving

1751
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:04,639
and cringing and fowning fear. He has

1752
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:07,280
given us a spirit of what? Power and of

1753
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:10,280
love. and listen and of calm and

1754
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:12,560
wellbalanced mind and disciplined and

1755
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:15,360
self-control. That's a sign of a man who

1756
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,360
is not

1757
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:21,159
afraid. You see, when you have fear in

1758
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:23,560
your spirit, your mind goes out of

1759
01:36:21,159 --> 01:36:26,280
balance. It becomes

1760
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:31,000
double. And the Bible says that a

1761
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:35,199
doubleminded man should not expect to

1762
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:39,159
receive anything from God. Is he given?

1763
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:42,320
Yes. But he will struggle to

1764
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:44,719
receive. He didn't say should he shall

1765
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,880
let that man not think that he shall be

1766
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:49,360
given

1767
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:52,239
anything. Who got it? He did not say a

1768
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:55,199
double-minded man let that man not think

1769
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:58,960
that he will be given anything. No. The

1770
01:36:55,199 --> 01:37:02,080
Lord stays true. He has given. But let

1771
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:05,280
that man not think he shall receive

1772
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:08,800
anything. So the mind double struggles

1773
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,800
to receive what has been

1774
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:15,040
given and there is nothing that divides

1775
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:18,440
the mind of a man and takes him out of

1776
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:22,480
balance like the spirit of

1777
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:24,440
fear because fear counts the options

1778
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:27,119
outside God's

1779
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:30,199
purpose that either you think may derail

1780
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:33,280
you or overpower what God has

1781
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:34,880
said. What if it doesn't work? What if

1782
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:38,320
what if people Okay, I'm going to start

1783
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,320
the business, but what if people don't

1784
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:45,480
come? I'm going to do the concert, but

1785
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,159
what if people don't come? That's

1786
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:50,960
fear. You won't take off or for some of

1787
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:53,119
you have taken off. You cannot sustain

1788
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,199
what God has given you. Cuz some of the

1789
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:58,320
fears don't come when we want to start.

1790
01:37:55,199 --> 01:38:00,239
Some of them find us on the way.

1791
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:03,080
If I can tell you how many things have

1792
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:06,000
threatened some of

1793
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:08,800
us if we were fearful men would not be

1794
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,800
standing on this pull

1795
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:13,960
pit. One time a very small man and I

1796
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:17,760
call him small because he's

1797
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:23,040
small. He walked to me and told me your

1798
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:23,040
ministry in Uganda has come to an

1799
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:30,239
end. Can you imagine? Now imagine I was

1800
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,400
like some of you ah let me let me flee

1801
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,400

1802
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:41,280
Franceh somebody has told me he told me

1803
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:43,360
how open your ministry in Uganda has

done. I'm still preaching the gospel.

1810
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:10,480
Not gospel. Gospel. There's a

1811
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,510

01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:22,080
Hallelujah. Don't be

1816
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:26,199
intimidated. Refuse to fear. Fear is a

1817
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:29,040
spirit. If I find myself

1818
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:32,040
afraid, I don't turn my eyes to what I

1819
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:35,440
fear. I turn my eyes to the

1820
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:37,520
spirit. Kennethy Hagen told me that if

1821
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:40,000
you ever find yourself afraid, don't

1822
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:43,400
turn to the thing or examine the thing

1823
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:47,000
you fear. Turn to the

1824
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:53,280
fear and tell it, "You

1825
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:56,159
spirit of fear, I command you to go."

1826
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:59,560
The moment you rebuke it, you that's the

1827
01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:02,800
day you realize that fear is a

1828
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:06,440
spirit. That's the day you realize that

1829
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:08,800
fear is a

1830
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:10,620
spirit. Of course, that journey will

1831
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,159
overwhelm you.

None of us fits into the mantles God has

1834
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:19,000
placed on our lives. If you fit in a

1835
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:21,360
mantle, then that's not

1836
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
God-given. Whatever God gives you will

1837
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,520
always be bigger than

1838
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,600
you because it's the only way he will

1839
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,960
show the world that the thing working on

1840
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:33,520
her or him is not of him. It goes beyond

1841
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:36,880
your ability. It goes beyond your your

1842
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:39,199
your potential. It goes beyond anything

1843
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:42,320
in you to perform. Our mantles are

1844
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:45,020
always bigger than us. So sometimes

1855
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,960
One man said something I'll never

1856
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,880
forget. He said, "When you cast your

1857
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,880
care to the Lord, when you give it to

1858
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,679
him and say, "Father, I started this

1859
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,080
house. The rains are coming. What I

1860
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:25,280
started is

1861
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:27,080
falling. When you get it and it's a care

1862
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,480
and you cast

1863
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,480
it upon

1864
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:37,679
him, leave it there.

1865
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:39,760
Don't pick it again. The problem with

1866
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:43,560
Christians is they they say, "Father, I

1867
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:46,040
cast my care upon you for your

1868
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:49,840
care." 2 minutes

1869
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:52,560
later, but the bricks are breaking. Oh,

1870
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:56,159
I cast my care upon you in the mighty

1871
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,159

1872
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:02,800

1873
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:05,840
always casting, picking, casting,

1874
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,719
picking. When you give it and say,

1875
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:12,480
"Father, I've cast this care to you." It

1876
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,480
means you'll never collect it

1877
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:17,280

cast when she brings a conversation

1886
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:40,280

1913

1919
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,639
might take a few weeks. But one day

1920
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:16,960
you'll see me on

I've spoken. It might take a year. It

1923
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:27,679

1933
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,660

1937
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:02,520
God, you told me that if I give it to

1938
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:05,760
you, I'll never

1939
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:09,400

us is

2035
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:01,080
ready. That the

2036
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:05,040
groundwork has been

2037
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:07,199
laid. That everything has been arranged

2038
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:13,000
to completion.

2039
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:17,080
So I release the power to enter what is

2040
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,800
already ready for us. Number

2041
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:21,480
two, that we will

2042
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,960
not

2043
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:28,800
procrastinate. We take initiative. We

2044
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:31,560
receive the power and the boldness to

2045
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:35,199
take the steps that are

2046
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:37,840
necessary to take possession.

2047
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:41,719
And number three, Lord, we rebuke and

2048
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:43,760
judge the spirit of fear and

2049
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:47,080
discouragement. Every spirit that has

2050
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:51,560
been looming over the minds of your

2051
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:55,119
people to scare them from what's already

2052
01:50:51,560 --> 01:51:00,040
theirs in the name of Jesus, those

2053
01:50:55,119 --> 01:51:02,159
spirits are judged today. No

2054
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:05,320
discouragement. And I decree that

2055
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:08,520
everybody that has listened to this

2056
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:11,639
sermon. You're you're taking

2057
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:15,320
possession. You're going to do the

2058
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:17,679
impossible. You're going to do big for

2059
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:21,360
God. You're going to do things that

2060
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:24,960
don't look like you, that don't match

2061
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:26,679
anything about you in Jesus name. If you

2062
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:31,960
receive it, say

2063
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:31,960
amen. Come on, say amen.

2064
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:38,480
Watch me. Tell your neighbor, "Watch me.

2065
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,920
Watch me." Now, if you're here and

2066
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,840
you've never given your life to Christ,

2067
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,520
this is the most important moment to

2068
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,880
heaven. I will ask the attention of

2069
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,360
every man, even those who are moving,

2070
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,560
stop moving. Let's get people saved. If

2071
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,719
you're here and you've never given your

2072
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:53,480
life to

2073
01:51:49,719 --> 01:51:56,000
Jesus, salvation is ready for

2074
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:59,199
you. Just come and enter. Come as you

2075
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,880
are. God will fix you. Don't first fix.

2076
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:02,159
Don't procrastinate. So if you're there

2077
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,199
and you want to give your life to Jesus

2078
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:04,760
and those of you are in the live

2079
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:06,960

come. Let's celebrate as I come.

2086
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,159
They harvest his

2088
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:39,599
gave his only

01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:44,920
son.

2090
01:52:43,239 --> 01:52:49,260
Whosoever

2091
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:52,369

life. Hurry, hurry, come. Don't let

2095
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:02,239
anything hold you

back. And he

2098
01:53:08,119 --> 01:53:13,199
gave his

2099
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:13,199
only

2100
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:18,920
son who saw it.

2101
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:26,090

2103
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:34,599

2106
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:50,040
came.

2107
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:50,040
Whosoever believe

2108
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:56,080

2109
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:06,840

For God so loved the

2117
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:45,599
world and he gave

2118
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,840
me whatsoever.

[Music]

2120
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:09,340
Hallelujah. Let's celebrate Jesus.

2121
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:14,169
[Applause]

2122

[Music]

2123
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:19,800
Man, the spirit shows me people are

2124
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:21,760
going to build things in this coming few

2125
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:25,880
months. There is somebody you're going

2126
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:28,599
to be entering your your house by

2127
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:31,199
December, by next year

2128
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:34,360
June, that business will be making a

2129
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:37,920
billion shillings in the name of

2130
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:41,199
Jesus. By next year August, your

2131
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:44,679
ministry will not be compared to where

2132
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:47,599
you are now. In the name of

2133
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:50,159
Jesus, I feel the power that enters

2134
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:53,119
things. The power that takes possession

2135
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:55,199
is here this evening. You're going to do

2136
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:56,920
things that nobody in your family has

2137
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:59,599
ever

2138
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:03,119
done. It's going to be big to the glory

2139
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:06,980
of God. Say amen. Let's celebrate Jesus

2140
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:10,120
for those who are receiving him today.

2141
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:10,120
[Music]

2142
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:14,800
There's a gentleman here in a white

2143
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:17,599
suit. He came red. I mean he has entered

2144
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,599
the kingdom in

2145
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:23,400
white. Like the way he has come. There's

2146
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:26,199
the way Jesus cannot reject

2147
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:28,639
him. He's entering the kingdom in

2148
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:33,800
fashion. Even the angels are like ah

2149
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:37,360
this guy came ready. You came ready. My

2150
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:40,560
God he didn't come as you were. No, he

2151
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:41,150
edited himself and said today God I must

2152
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:46,520
come

2153
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:48,880
[Music]

2154
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:50,080
holy. Now the rest of us just repeat

2155
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:52,440
these words after me. Look at this

2156
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:55,760
harvest. Let's celebrate

2157
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:58,320
Jesus. But you see, you must see them.

2158
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:00,320
You must see them. You must see them. If

2159
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,760
you don't see them, they don't come.

2160
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:06,960
They don't even attend

2161
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:06,960
service. Repeat it.

2162
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,239
Somebody's

2163
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:14,239
coming. Praise the

2164
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:16,679
Lord. We needed a lot of convincing. But

2165
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:20,159
you see, you're here,

2166
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:22,880
brother. I was like that also. Now, see,

2167
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:22,880
I'm preaching the

2168
01:57:23,159 --> 01:57:26,239
gospel. All right, ladies and gentlemen,

2169
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:28,400
and those of you who are watching

2170
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:30,800
online, uh, who are in the streaming

2171
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:32,880
centers or on television, repeat these

2172
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,960
words after me and speak loud. Say,

2173
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:37,880
"Father

2174
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:39,800
God, I thank you for the

2175
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:42,199
gift of

2176
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:47,960
Jesus because he

2177
01:57:42,199 --> 01:57:52,800
died for my sins and was raised for my

2178
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:56,639
glory. Today, I receive Jesus as my

2179
01:57:52,800 --> 01:58:00,800
personal Lord and Savior. I'm born

2180
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:04,000
again. I'm transformed. I'm changed by

2181
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,440
the power of the living God. Amen. Put

2182
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,440
up your hands. Even those who are

2183
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:12,159
watching right now, I pray that may God

2184
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:14,800
keep you. May he preserve you. May he

2185
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:17,760
lead you. May he deliver you from your

2186
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:20,400
past. Your past could mean witchcraft.

2187
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:23,400
Your p Oh, get out you spirit of

2188
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,400
darkness.

2189
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:31,880
Your past could mean drug

2190
01:58:28,599 --> 01:58:34,480
addiction. Go in the name of

2191
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:37,119
Jesus. Your past could mean could mean

2192
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:38,719
perversion. Your past could mean any

2193
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:40,320
manner of bondage. Somebody something

2194
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,400
has been strangling you every night. You

2195
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:45,040
wake up and you're not breathing. Go.

2196
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:47,840
You spirit of darkness. I command you to

2197
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:50,080
lose in the name of Jesus. Your past

2198
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,239
could be sickness. I command that

2199
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:54,560
sickness to leave your body right now in

2200
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:57,520
the name of Jesus. Your past could be

2201
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:59,280
struggle and strife. I decree and I

2202
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,800
declare that from today you will not

2203
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:05,560
struggle or strife in Jesus name. Give

2204
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:09,520
the Lord a mighty angel of

2205
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:11,880
praise. Listen the best gift you can

2206
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:15,520
give yourself is to keep coming to

2207
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:17,440
church. Allow God to use you to feed you

2208
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:20,000
to grow you. We have services on Sunday

2209
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:22,080
9 to 11 first service second service is

2210
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
11 to1 the the second one is usually

2211
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,400
here longer because some people in the

2212
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,080
second service love it longer so I'll

2213
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,920
